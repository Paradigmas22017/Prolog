from dlecoint garnet acns fsu edu darius lecointe newsgroups soc religion christian subject re sabbath admissions of message id apr athos rutgers edu date apr gmt sender hedrick athos rutgers edu organization florida state university lines approved christian aramis rutgers edu someone sent me this faq by e mail and i post my response here i m not enforcing the inclusion limits on this faq because most of our readers probably haven t seen it clh christ warns that anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven matt this faq is so full of error that i must respond to it i hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology brothers and sisters being new to the faith and examining the decalogue closely i ve noticed the fourth commandment is pretty specific about keeping the sabbath day it states the th day saturday is the sabbath while most christian religions keep or atleast go to church on sunday what s up this is a frequently asked question every time it arises it causes months of debate so let me see if i can answer you directly basically it s because the law was given to moses as part of a specific covenanent with the jews most of us aren t jews so we aren t part of that covenant there was an argument early in christian history about whether the mosaic laws should apply to gentiles who became christians you can see the account of this debate in acts the main question there was circumcision but keeping the sabbath would be part of it as well the apostles concluded that we need not become jews in order to become christians and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount sinai rom notes that where no law is there is no transgression not only did sin exist before sinai eden but the sabbath was kept before it was revealed on sinai ex the problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promise which undergirded it god wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people but in their ignorance after years of slavery they promised what ever he says to do we will do that is why the new covenant is based on better promises heb rather than do away with the law god promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts heb including the sabbath in the acts is selective inclusion the sabbath was more important to the jews than circumcision if any attempt had been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in acts do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law ceremonial which was added because of transgression of the moral law gal israel stands for god s people of all time that is why god grafted the gentiles in roma says that the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of god and the promises belong to israelites in explanation paul makes it clear that being born into israel is not enough for they are not all israel which are of israel v then in gal he says if ye be christ s then are ye abraham s seed and heirs according to the promise all christians are abraham s seed jews israelites not physically for that is not the criterion but spiritually we are joint heirs with jesus based on the promise god made to all his people the israelites while christians agree that the ot laws do not all apply to us because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the jews we also expect to see some similarity between the things god expected from the jews and the things he expects from us after all it s the same god however there are several ways of dealing with this these days the most common approach is to separate the ot commandments into moral and ceremonial ceremonial commandments apply only to the jews they are part of the specific mosaic covenant these are thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision moral laws apply to everyone most of the commands are part of the moral law except for the commandment about the sabbath i believe most people who take this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on the sabbath is part of the ceremonial law but a general obligation to worship regularly is part of the general moral law thus christians are free to choose the specific time we worship people would probably agree but they are wrong how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws you are not free to choose your time of worship even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship would you rather give up a day which god blessed sanctified and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation see sabbath admissions in soc religion christian bible study a more radical approach which is generally connected with john calvin and the reformed tradition says that the law as a whole is no longer binding instead we are entirely under grace and our behavior should be guided solely by love portions of the ot law are still useful as guidance but they are not properly speaking legally binding on us in practice most people who take this position do not believe it is safe to leave christians without moral guidannce while we may no longer be under law as sinners it s not safe for us to go into situations with no principles to guide us we re too good at self justification for that to be safe thus christians do have moral guidance from things like jesus teachings paul s advice etc these may not be precisely a law but they serve much the same function as and have largely the same content as the moral law in the previous analysis while calvin would deny that we have a fixed legal responsibility to worship on any specific day he would say that given human weakness the discipline of regular worship is important i do not care what calvin or any theologian says my guide is what god says if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the sabbath commandment which is the only one god thought was important enough to say remember if you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of god if a cop pulls me over for speeding then in court i ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace do i walk out of the court saying i can now go on speeding for i am now under grace being under grace i now drive within the speed limit paul adds to it in rom di we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good rom in both analyses the specific day is not an issue as a matter of tradition we worship on sunday as a memorial of christ s resurrection there s some debate about what acts shows about early christian worship the most common analysis is that is shows jewish christians continuing to go to jewish services on the sabbath but that specifically christian service were not necessarily held then act shows worship on the first day sunday and i cor also implies gatherings on that day there are a few groups that continue to believe christians have to worship on the sabbath saturday the best known are the seventh day adventists and jehovah s witnesses they argue that act is not a regular worship service but a special meeting to see paul off and that i cor doesn t explicitly say it s a regular worship service do you prefer implication to fact a careful study of the acts shows that the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul did not go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot to assos in icor there is no way you can equate lay by him in store with go to a worship service it s clear that this issue was a contested one in paul s time see rom paul s advice is that we should be very careful about judging each other on issues like this one person sees a specific day as mandated by god while another does not he who observes that specific day does it in honor of the lord he who believes his worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the lord those who believe that the sabbath is still mandated argue that paul is not referring to sabbath worship here note however col which says something similar but briefer it explicitly mentions sabbath wrong these are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law not the sabbath day of the moral law there are some differences among christians about use of the word sabbath originally the term referred to the th day the jewish day of worship many christians now use it to refer to sunday the day of christian worship they do this largely so that they can apply the th or whatever there are a couple of different numbering schemes commandment to it reformed tradition does not do this it distinguishes between the sabbath which is the observance mandated for jews and the lord s day which is the free christian worship the only reference i can find to this in the nt is rev there are also differences about laws regarding this day many christians support blue laws both in secular law and church law setting aside that day and causing people to spend it in worship the more radical anti legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the jewish sabbath which is not appropriate to the free christian worship of the lord s day why would you prefer to twist and turn relying on different arguments which conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from a god who loved you enough to die for you jesus died because the law could not be changed why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable that is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws it will always be a sin to make false gods to violate god s name to break the sabbath to steal to kill etc except it you disagree but then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of god darius it s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq i think paul s comments on esteeming one day over another rom is probably all that needs to be said i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the lord however i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every sunday for worship we get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this question act describes christians as participating both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion services in homes obviously the temple worship is on the sabbath acts is an example of christians participating in them unfortunately it doesn t tell us what day christians met in their houses acts despite darius confusion is described by acts as occuring on sunday i see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start when the biblical text is clear about what was meant the wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting it doesn t say they gathered to see paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread paul talked about his upcoming travel but that s just not explicit enough to be really convincing similarly with cor it says that on the first day they should set aside money for paul s collection now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this or that they did it in their homes i can t disprove it but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was clh,soc.religion.christian

elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again mark for he was teaching his disciples and telling them the son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men and they will kill him and when he has been killed he will rise three days later mark and they will mock him and spit upon him and scourge him and kill him and three days later he will rise again mark but regarding the fact that the dead rise again have you not read in the book of moses in the passage about the burning bush how god spoke to him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob luke and after they have scourged him they will kill him and the third day he will rise again luke and he said to them thus it is written that the christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day john jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me shall live even if he dies john for as yet they did not understand the scripture that he must rise again from the dead acts explaining and giving evidence that the christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead and saying this jesus whom i am proclaiming to you is the christ the witness of the apostle paul corinthians now i make known to you brethren the gospel which i preached to you which also you received in which also you stand by which also you are saved if you hold fast the word which i preached to you unless you believed in vain for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures and that he appeared to cephas then to the twelve after that he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time most of whom remain until now but some have fallen asleep then he appeared to james then to all the apostles and last of all as it were to one untimely born he appeared to me also for i am the least of the apostles who am not fit to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me did not prove vain but i labored even more than all of them yet not i but the grace of god with me whether then it was i or they so we preach and so you believed now if christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there is no resurrection of the dead not even christ has been raised and if christ has not been raised then our preaching is vain your faith also is vain moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of god because we witnessed against god that he raised christ whom he did not raise if in fact the dead are not raised for if the dead are not raised not even christ has been raised and if christ has not been raised your faith is worthless you are still in your sins then those also who have fallen asleep in christ have perished if we have hoped in christ in this life only we are of all men most to be pitied but now christ has been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who are asleep for since by a man came death by a man also came the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all die so also in christ all shall be made alive but each in his own order christ the first fruits after that those who are christ s at his coming then comes the end when he delivers up the kingdom to the god and father when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet the last enemy that will be abolished is death logical proofs of jesus christ s resurrection jesus s enemies would not have stolen his body because that would have perpetrated the resurrection the very opposite of what they desired jesus disciples could not have stolen his body because pontius pilate established guards to stand watch over the tomb lest his body be stolen sadly and ironically many of jesus disciples did not believe in the resurrection until jesus had risen from the dead in nearly centuries no body has ever been produced to refute jesus assertion that he would indeed rise from the dead the probability of being able to perpetrate such a hoax successfully upon the entire world for nearly centuries is astronomically negative,soc.religion.christian

you anyway feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says may god richly bless those who read it d o e s g o d l o v e y o u q what kind of question is that anyone who can read sees signs tracts books and bumper stickers that say god loves you isn t that true a it is true that god offers his love to the whole world as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the bible for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john however god s love is qualified the bible says the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness proverbs for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish psalm q but i am not wicked i am a decent moral person surely the good i have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad i have done how can these verses apply to me a by god s standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by god as a desperate sinner on his way to hell the bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven on the contrary we are all sinners and we are all guilty before god as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god romans the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it jeremiah q if i am such a wicked person in god s sight what will god do to me a the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called hell for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust deuteronomy q oh come on now hell is not real is it surely things are not that bad a indeed hell is very real and things are that bad for the individ ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior the bible makes many references to hell indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire revelation so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth matthew when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power thessalonians q that is terrible why would god create a hell a hell is terrible and it exists because god created man to be accountable to god for his actions god s perfect justice demands payment for sin for the wages of sin is death romans for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad corinthians but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment matthew q does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell a indeed it does that is unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins that someone is god himself who came to earth as jesus christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all isaiah but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed isaiah for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures corinthians for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him corinthians q are you saying that if i trust in christ as my substitute who was already punished for my sins then i will not have to worry about hell anymore a yes this is so if i have believed in christ as my savior then it is as if i have already stood before the judgment throne of god christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him john q but what does it mean to believe on him if i agree with all that the bible says about christ as savior then am i saved from going to hell a believing on christ means a whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the bible it means that we hang our whole lives on him it means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the bible it means that we turn away from our sins and serve christ as our lord no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon matthew repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord acts q are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except through jesus what about all the other religions will their followers also go to hell a yes indeed they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account able for our sins god demands that we pay for our sins other religions cannot provide a substitute to bear the sins of their followers christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me john if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness john q now i am desperate i do not want to go to hell what can i do a you must remember that god is the only one who can help you you must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god as you see your hopeless condition as a sinner cry out to god to save you and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner luke sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved acts q but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him a wonderfully god not only saves us through the lord jesus but he also gives us the faith to believe on him you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god ephesians god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith so if you really mean business with god about your salvation you should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible which is the only word of god in this brochure all verses from the bible are within indented paragraphs give heed to them with all your heart so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god romans q but does this mean that i have to surrender everything to god a yes god wants us to come to him in total humility acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally in him the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise psalm because we are sinners we love our sins therefore we must begin to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins and if we sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sins as god strengthens us we know that our sins are sending us to hell unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities acts q doesn t the bible teach that i must attend church regularly and be baptized will these save me a if possible we should do these things but they will not save us no work of any kind can secure our salvation salvation is god s sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas ure salvation is not of works lest any man should boast ephesians q what else will happen at the end of the world a those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever more for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord thessalonians q what will happen to the earth at that time a god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever more but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness peter q does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come a yes the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to save and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come matthew q can we know how close to the end of the world we might be a yes god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved it will not come as a thief for the believers there is much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very very close all the time clues in the bible point to this for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape thessalonians surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amos q but that means judgment day is almost here a yes it does god warned ancient nineveh that he was going to destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning and jonah began to enter into the city a day s journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown jonah q what did the people of nineveh do a from the king on down they humbled themselves before god repented of their sins and cried to god for mercy but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not jonah q did god hear their prayers a yes god saved a great many people of nineveh q can i still cry to god for mercy so that i will not come into judg ment a yes there is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him hebrews in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your

united states of amer ica or call the foregoing is a copy of the does god love you tract printed by and available free of charge from family radio a number of minor changes have been made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and distribution the only change to the text itself is the paragraph which describes the way in which biblical passages appear within the text in the original tract they appear in italic lettering they appear here as indented paragraphs i have read mr camping s book compared it with what the bible actual ly says find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the future holds that i have ever come across and agree with him that there is just too much data to ignore while none of us is guaranteed one more second of life and while we therefore should take these matters very seriously regardless of when christ will actually return it would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal destiny until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless now because in all likelihood the law of averages with respect to life expectancy no longer applies if you wish to obtain a copy of this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself you may find the following information helpful title author harold camping publisher vantage press distributor baker and taylor isbn i have chosen to share this tract with you because i whole heartedly agree with everything it declares and feel that now perhaps more than ever before this information must be made known to paraphrase acts it does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of god i am always willing to discuss the eternal truths of the bible with anyone who is interested as i believe them to be the only issues of any real importance

sarcastic they are not i have written this reply in the most even handed manner that i can with no emotions boiling to the surface as it was written please accept this as a serious attempt to foster dialog and rest assurred that i make every attempt to make fun of no one except myself gsu uxa ecn bgu edu eric molas writes firstly i am an atheist i am not posting here as an immature flame start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience the human being is an animal who has due to his her advanced mental facilities developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable hmmm there are other animals on this planet with advanced mental facilities which have not developed religion as a satisfactory explaination for the unexplained why is this so further it appears that only humans have a need to explain the unexplained why is this so the other animals on this planet including those with advanced mental facilities seem perfectly content in their ignorance i d like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me from your unsupported statement they are humans are animal only religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need not be researched religion was made up by humans to address a perceived need the biological aspect of humans is deified that is all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical structure with biology at the apex needless to say i disagree with your strong opinion and the underlying presuppositions christianity is an infectious cult the reasons it flourishes are because it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind oh wow all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness for all of you found jeezus how many of you were on the brink i disagree that christianity is an infectious cult it has certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system in spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia that it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is infectious in a derrogatory sense it may be that it provides a workable system for its adherents and i would argue that this is the case i disagree that christianity is a safety blanket which supplants hope and purpose rather it points an individual to the one source of hope and purpose there is nothing hidden about a christian s source for hope and purpose of what usefulness to you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose and externally given hope and purpose is the apparent loss of control over one s own life the problem or is it something else finally one does not appropriate eternal happiness by following christian moral standards indeed the sole reason for the existance of christianity is because standards are inadequate to save people from their imperfections moral standards are merely guides to the christian the real power to moral living is given to the christian in the person of god s spirit heaven is one of two final states that christian doctrine postulates however christians are generally not motivated to live according to christian moral standards by this promised future reward rather they are motivated by the perceived benefits to them in the here and now but i digress the other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature a best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this priority spread the word many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a priority and rightly so for it was jesus himself who gave this as a priority for his followers however it is not the penultimate priority as evangelism is normally understood i e preach the word convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangelism is generally best done through respecting the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits of a christian lifestyle this demonstration should be so powerful that it compels the non christian to seek out the christian to ask why needless to say such a demonstration is not easily accom plished it takes a radical committment to the person of jesus it does not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian is required and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of friendship exist it is ineffective with strangers who cannot evaluate the demonstration over time and it is easy to alienate or harm others if the sole purpose of being a friend is to gain a conversion as a long time christian nearly years i view with some skep ticism all evangelism programs which incorporate a hurry up attitude pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no conversion at all because the pressured convert realizes s he was coerced and disavows christianity when they would have been open to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now the bible states that it is the very spirit of god which brings conviction of wrong doing to people i am content to do my part witness and let the spirit do the rest we are just animals we need sleep food and we reproduce and we die we are far more than animals we sleep eat reproduce and die just as other animals do true but we are also capable of more than this if your personal vision of humanity or of yourself is so limited i can only hope and pray that you will someday find a more expansive view for reflection what animals have the wide variety of performing arts that humans do how is it that humans can learn the language of other humans or animals but that other animals cannot do so how is it that humans can organize themselves in various social structures whereas other animals have only one structure religion especially christianity is nothing more than a drug blatant assertion christianity is not physically addictive christianity is not psychologically addictive christianity is not a thing which one snorts ingests shoots up it is a relationship with a living being you might as validly characterize any close knit relationship with this appelation some people use drugs as an escape from reality christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high there are jesus freaks who let the emotional aspects of worship and christian living gain and retain the upper hand even so this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these things flow it pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars of which christianity has had no small part guilty by association that christianity which forces itself upon another is not christianity at all when christians see a non believer they say that person is blind to the truth but they cannot realize that it is they who live with this mask of fakeness each day jesus was just prophet who happened to have a large influence because at that time the romans were circa ad dispersing the jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need you appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened years ago how did you come by it i cannot accept your conclusion that jesus influence was a sole result of the roman sack of jerusalem in ad he was years gone by this time it strains the bounds of credulity to assert that nothing about jesus life was noteworthy until the sack i must go these are but a few of my thoughts on christianity christianity is having a relationship with jesus christ himself what do you know of

organization university of pennsylvania lines approved christian aramis rutgers edu in article apr athos rutgers edu trajan stephen mcintyre writes in article apr athos rutgers edu writes i can only reply with what it says in timothy i m not here to discount parts of the bible rather i m here only to discount the notion of revelation the author of timothy told what he thought was the truth based on his belief in god his faith in jesus as the resurrected son and his readings of the old testament but again what had been revealed to him was based on at best second hand information given by friends and authors who may not have given the whole truth or who may have exaggerated a bit first of all the original poster misquoted the reference is from tim the author was paul and his revelations were anything but at best second hand and is came about that as saul journeyed he was approaching damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him saul saul why are you persecuting me and he said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom you are persecuting acts nas paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus pretty cool eh he became closely involved with the early church the leaders of which were followers of jesus throughout his ministry on earth now you may say the holy spirit revealed these things unto him and we could go into that argument but you d be hard pressed to convince me that the holy spirit exists i agree i don t believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you the spirit exists please don t complain about this being circular i know it is but really can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural this is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the bible additionally what he has written is again second hand info if it were given by the spirit and still carries the chance it is not true the spirit is part of god how much closer to the source can you get the greek in timothy which is sometimes translated as inspired by god literally means god breathed in other words god spoke the actual words into the scriptures many theologians and bible scholars dr james boice is one that i can remember off hand get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of inspired by god the only way you would be able to escape this notion of second hand info is to have had the entire bible written by god himself and to tell the truth i ve studied the bible extensively and have yet to hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence showing god as the first author of this collection of books that s what the verse taken from timothy was all about the continuity of a book written over a span of years by more than authors from all walks of life is a testimony to the single authorship of god and as for reason read what it says in corinthians about human wisdom basically it says that human wisdom is useless when compared with what god has written for our learning if you knew of jesus as well as you know the bible you d realize he reasoned out the law and the prophets for the common man what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the bible certainly not josephus writings or the writings of the gnostics which were third century at the earliest and though some claim jesus was he was human with all of the human wisdom the apostle paul set out to criticize yet would you not embrace the idea that jesus was wise jesus was fully god as well that s why i d assert that he is wise i realise that you may not accept the authority of the bible this is unfortunate to say the least because there is no other way of learning about god and christ and god s purpose with the earth than reading the bible and searching out its truth for yourself for your information i was raised without any knowledge of god by the time some of the faithful came to show me the word and share with me its truth i was living happily and morally without acknowledging the existence of a supreme being i have though read the bible several times over in its entirety and have studied it thoroughly it contains truth in it and i consider jesus to be one of the most moral of human beings to have lived in fact i darn near idolize the guy but there s no rational reason for me to except god s existence please rethink this last paragraph if there is no god which seems to be your current belief then jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that god exists but he claimed to be god himself regards to c s lewis how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus in conclusion be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars unsubstantiated claims the bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out about your reading of the bible not only does the spirit inspire the writers but he guides the reader as well we cannot understand it in the least without the spirit s guidance for to us god revealed them through the spirit for the spirit searches all things even the depths of god cor nas peace and may god guide us in wisdom carter c page of happiness the crown and chiefest part is wisdom a carpenter s apprentice and to hold god in awe this is the law that cpage seas upenn edu seeing the stricken heart of pride brought down we learn when we are old adapted from sophocles other theologians get quite annoyed at the misleadingess of god breathed it s true that the greek word has as its roots god and breath however etymology doesn t necessarily tell you what a word means otherwise goodbye would be a religious expression since it comes from god be with ye you have to look at how the word was actually used in this case the word is used for wisdom or dreams that come from god but god breathed is an overtranslation clh,soc.religion.christian

writes in article apr athos rutgers edu caralv caralv auto trol com carol alvin writes are all truths also absolutes is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes the answer to both questions is yes perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then to me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations etc true in every instance possible do you agree with this definition i think you do similarly all truth is absolute indeed a non absolute truth is a contradiction in terms when is something absolute when it is always true obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a contradiction in terms i agree with carol here determining absolutes is practically speaking a waste of time and we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relative for example i recently was asking some children the question what temperature does water boil at i got the answer degrees consistently i asked if they knew what scale and was told it s just degrees any scale that s what all thermometers say well that s sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong it is not an absolute truth similarly scripture is full of truth which we should nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point then religion easily becomes an intellectual head trip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism imo example of head covering in church deleted this was a good example there may be an absolute truth behind the writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the corinthians and not necessarily elsewhere the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth which was having a lot of trouble with order is it absolute truth to me no and i see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there are plenty of other examples can you reconcile this even the most die hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally i ve yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally the bible was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world such a statement is terribly self contradictory let me put it to you this way if there are no absolutes shouldn t we conclude that the statement there are no absolutes is not absolutely true obviously we have a contradiction here i don t claim that there are no absolutes i think there are very few though and determining absolutes is difficult i agree very few and even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference since i know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me there is hardly consensus even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation so people sometimes disagree about what is true this does not negate the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe i can t prove the existence of absolutes i can only rely upon my experience i also trust god s revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinite therefore we can t comprehend the absolutes so i don t need them i can never know the essence of god only the energies by and through which god is manifested to god s creation so the reality can be that there are absolutes but it is of no practical importance it s like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be swell who cares it doesn t affect me in any practical useful way i might as well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that they live on mars maybe god did so what is that going to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor or god whether or not i go to this or that cafeteria for lunch no this attitude leads many non christians to believe that all christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning christianity is true wonderful and sensible it appeals to reason since reason is an inner reflection of the logos of god explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world note i m not claiming there is no place for authority that d be silly there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that and is generally agressive good parents like god are authoritative many christians are simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few adults respond to this treatment larry overacker llo shell com lawrence

edu family magazine sysops organization st elizabeth hospital youngstown oh lines approved christian aramis rutgers edu the empty tomb can we trust it by the late wilbur m smith d d when jesus was on earth he made an amazing prediction about himself and frequently repeated it let me quote it for you behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again matthew wholly different from the normal experience of men jesus who had never done anything worthy of death even deserving reproval knew he would die before he was years of age he knew the very city where he would die he knew that the religious leaders of his own race would condemn him to death he knew that one of his own would betray him he knew that before his actual death took place he would be mocked and scourged he knew exactly how he would die by crucifixion all this is in itself remarkable but more amazing than the minute particulars of his foreknowledge was what he predicted would follow shortly after he was buried that he would rise again he even designated the time on the third day but since it is on this central fact the death and resurrec tion of jesus christ that the whole truth or untruth of chris tianity turns let us examine it more closely the body of jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed the body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used and a great stone was rolled against the entrance the jewish authorities fully aware that jesus had predicted he would rise again had the stone officially sealed and on saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body early sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body to their utter astonishment they found the stone rolled away the body gone they rushed back to tell the disciples shortly two of jesus friends peter and john utterly skeptical about the whole affair came and found the tomb empty just as the women had said even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone matthew how did this tomb become empty one of the most famous new testament scholars in america professor of new testament literature in a large theological seminary wrote to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb became empty and wrote it in a letter not marked by bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the chimney at christmas time but he didn t realize that santa clause never did come down any chimney at christmas time because there never was a santa claus and there is a jesus he died he was buried in the tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sunday the body was gone those are facts of history no one can escape the responsi bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old another professor dr kirsopp lake of harvard university tried to explain the empty tomb by saying what no other scholar in the field of new testament criticism has ventured to adopt that the women went to the wrong tomb the facts are these first so far as we know there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone second it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days even if the women did miss the tomb when peter and john came did they too go to the wrong tomb third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb there is of course a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor s ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is com monly reported among the jews until this day matthew this is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty you will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb was empty they never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true they knew it was true another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty the soldiers were told to say that jesus disciples came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep how could they know what was going on while they were asleep obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of jesus first as professor heffern points out the leaders of judaism in jerusalem who had put the lord jesus to death had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his resurrection because all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty if there had been trickery here sooner or later it would have been suspected then proved second surely one of the disciples even most of them would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent it may be possible to live a lie but men seldom die for a lie and most of these men did the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories it would have lost it power instead this truth swept the world closed pagan temples won millions of disciples brought hope to a despairing humanity was the very foundation truth of the early church and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever but not only did jesus come alive again he did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to him instead he appeared to them literally visibly frequently he appeared to the women at the tomb on resurrection morning matthew later that day to mary magdalene alone john and to simon peter also alone luke in the afternoon he walked with two of his followers toward emmaus luke and that night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at jerusalem mark luke etc a week later he appeared to all eleven of the apostles probably at the same place john once he was seen by above brethren on a mountain in galilee i corinthians and finally to the apostles just before his ascension mark luke acts as with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor ically recorded appearances all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness but these theories are unreasonable without supporting evidence none has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances moreover while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle increase mather president of harvard timothy dwight president of yale nathan lord president of dartmouth edward hitchcock president of amherst mark hopkins president of williams john witherspoon president of princeton these men and countless others have believed it but suppose christ did rise from the dead what of it what has it to do with my life what has it to do with your life just this it seals with certitude the teachings of christ jesus taught many great truths especially many about himself he claimed to have come down from god he said he was the way to god he said he was the son of god who alone knew god perfectly he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life and no one else had it he said that whatever we ask god in his name he would grant it to us thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day he revealed that in these amazing unparalleled predictions he spoke the truth do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe that his words are all true the point is does not the truth of the resurrection convince us that he is none other than the one he claimed to be the son of god and then of course the fact that christ rose from the dead testifies that he has broken the power of death and that he will some day raise us also up from the grave as he promised in other words if this person jesus christ the son of god in all this he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life for he said a life built on him would know forgiveness of sins his compan ionship and help a joy that no circumstances can ever take away and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day those who have tried it down through the ages and there have been many have given their testimony and we today who believe also know,soc.religion.christian

indiana university lines approved christian aramis rutgers edu in article apr athos rutgers edu maarten van loon cwi nl maarten van loon writes hello fellow netters and fellow christians about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches to a bible study group alltough i do have a personal opinion on this issue i thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations my background member of a orthodox reformed church let us say a little the only unity i ve found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples i came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything into practice from those messages since becoming a disciple i ve found that when i travel to another church in the same movement they are just as accepting there as any other we had a retreat back in january when some of the congregation from louisville ky came up this retreat was for college students and it was as though i had known even the people from louisville for years and i had only become a disciple the previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky one of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self sacrifice that is only one area in which disciples stand out from christians also another part of unity is a common depth of conviction i ve also been a part of some christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved a lack of conviction about everything they believed that was why they could be unified they didn t care about the truth but delighted in getting along together the problem here in the netherlands is that there are two other churches denominations with the same characteristics both have the same confessions there are only some differences with respect to for example the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use our creeds in essence a lot of people of these three churches have to same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that is the question creeds what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly better so here is a first question can the congregation of christ be separated by walls of different denominations or is this definitely an untolerable situation according to the scriptures according to the scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going to be there as per a previous note i mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means there are also differences of opinion and belief however scripture states in the following directives i have no praise for you for your meetings do more harm than good in the first place i hear that when you come together as a church there re divisions among you and to some extent i believe it no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have god s approval corinthians how will god show his approval by fruitfulness see acts but before that there are these qualities devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for god all having everything in common glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor of the people all these are mentioned in acts god also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted look at stephen a man full of faith and of the holy spirit acts who was later stoned acts can one say that only one of these three churches is the true church of jesus christ one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement i have yet to find that but the closest one i ve found is the boston church of christ movement which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected it is also the only one i ve seen which is totally sold out to god a problem closely related to these question is can we cooperate with other christians from these two churches before there is a unity this question is especially important for those who think that only one church can be the true one as for cooperation that can always occur unity on the other hand may never occur as for those who think about only one church being the true one i remind them that mark states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they will not lose their reward as with the boston movement i ve heard numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples of course few people admit that they ve ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement i know i haven t maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you for your information we have a lot of organizations here which are founded by people of one specific church and whose members are all members of that church this has been considered as correct for years only a few years ago people started to discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process some organizations are opening their doors for people from other churches etc i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me a clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively this causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions i would not say at all that this is something correct for a church group to do for any reason in one of the churches i attended for example there was an internal clique of people who were on the different groups committees organizational heads of the congregation they rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he would ve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down but is still there so i must warn against such division within there s enough division without thanks for your opinions in advance maarten joe fisher,soc.religion.christian

tektronix inc beaverton or lines approved christian aramis rutgers edu i sent in something on this before but i believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described this is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time hl the standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of friedrich blass hermeneutrik und kritik einleitende und hilfsdisziplinen vol of handbuch der klassischen altertums wissenshaft noerdlingen beck portions of this are described in nibley the prophetic book op mormon pp slc deseret book if you want to attempt reading this be forewarned nibley describes blass as a typical german scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader nibley s extract from blass s work is in the form of rules for forgers it makes interesting reading i confess that i have not read blass s work only nibley s extract thereof my german falls far short of what would be required and as far as i know there is no english translation available however i believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame we will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery actually there are types of purportedly ancient documents alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof for example the dead sea scrolls these can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper inks and objects found with them this can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent for example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago perhaps even having been through several generations of copists this is more of a problem but can still be tested although the test is not likely to be simple we cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself it is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be they can only date the document and identify its culture of origin for example i ve heard of a letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to a king in what is now iraq if this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink assuming they have the holograph they could check the language content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a palestinian jew of that time however even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actually wrote it we would know what time and culture it came from but barring a known sample of jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison scholarship must stop there there is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was as i say i m no expert on blas s work i do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works specifically we might ask is the document internally consistent does it contradict itself if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it is a forgery the longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency for this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents is it consistent with the history and geography of the time again a short non specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter day forger would be able to escape detection here we look for the minor inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check the devil is in the details what about the literary style of the work figures of speech etc any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us are there any such odd phrases in this book if so do they fit in with the culture of course there are complications if the document has been translated or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it a few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies they cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don t necessarily prove forgery these tests can be quite effective given enough material to work with but they are not easy they require the skills of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc the questions to ask are is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin if there are things which don t fit how significant are they are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge later changes by copists or are they really significant there will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture the end result of any such testing is occasionally certain particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies however often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document or maybe parts of it is probably authentic or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions this is often unsettling to a generation raised on tv where all problems are solved in to minutes with time out for commercials it is however the real world and what scholarship has to offer,soc.religion.christian

uidaho edu lanphi moscow uidaho edu rob lanphier writes these are two conflicting statements to say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic i don t mind people shifting their position on an issue it irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made what about deuteronomy is it wrong now did jesus change that if anything he clarified the law such as in that quote you made in the following verses jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon the law giving clearer meaning to what god intended sure he does this however he doesn t address the notion of stoning non virgin brides because this needs no clarification are you going to deny that deuteronomy is not patently clear in its intent i see what you are getting at or at least i think i do correct me if i am mistaken but i think you are asking me if i still believe that we should uphold all of the laws pertaining to capital punishment for such things as adultery rape and other heinous crimes as you may recall jesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress who was caught in the act and brought before jesus and his reply let he who is without sin cast the first stone jesus does not deny the sentence that is to due for this violation of the law what do you think of this i think you will agree with me that there are in today s world a lot of modern day pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it what good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart i ll agree that there is a lot of modern day pharisees that know the bible from end to end and don t believe in it depending on how they use this knowledge they can be scary they can argue any position they desire and back it up with selected parts of the bible such pharisees include david koresh and adolph hitler i will qualify this by saying i don t know if they actually believed what they were preaching but the ends certainly made the means look frightening agreed however just as scary are those that don t know much of the bible but believe every word in fact this is probably scarier since there are far more of these people from what i ve seen in addition they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned pharisees since they don t know enough to debate with these people agreed also if one is to use the bible as a reference one must always be open to different interpretations as a christian i have the spirit of god to verify what i believe in the word if what the spirit tells me is not backed up in scripture then the spirit i am communicating with is not of god after all jesus tells us to test the spirits to know for sure that it is from god christianity is not just a set of rules it s a lifestyle that changes one s perspectives and personal conduct and it demands obedience to god s will no it demands obedience to a book if god came down and personally told me how i should behave then i would say that i would be doing god s will by doing it however if preachers pastors and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia even longer for the ot even if i follow everything in it with my heart i could scarcely be honest with myself by saying i m doing the will of god i obey what the spirit of god tells me to do the spirit will not violate anything that is written in the bible because that is the word of god i do not worship pastors preachers my wife my mother or my father what they tell me does not carry the weight of what god tells me to do and his commands are rienforced in the bible some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not that is their choice and i have to respect it because god respects it too well if god respects it so much how come there is talk in the bible about eternal damnation for non believers i see little respect eminating from the god of the bible i see a selfish and spiteful god eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting god if you choose to jump off a cliff you can hardly blame god for you going splat at the bottom he knows that if you choose to jump that you will die but he will not prevent you from making that choice in fact he sent his son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what lies below to prove that point jesus took that plunge himself but he being god was able to rise up again i have seen the example of christ and have chosen not to jump and i m trying to tell you not to jump or else you ll go splat you don t have to listen to me and i won t stop you if you decide to jump i only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge you owe it to yourself i don t like seeing anyone go splat god be with you malcolm

bitnet writes robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying things like it is held that cf kermit thread on what exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to look at the bible in order to see the truth but what of those who see biblical things differently from you are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it rick i think we can safely say robert is not the only person who understands the bible and the leadership of the lds church historicly never has let s consider some personal interpretations and see how much trust we should put in orthodox mormonism which could never be confused with orthodox christianity in one of his attacks on christians the mormon apostle bruce r mcconkie said they thrash around in darkness in trying to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised messiah he also said christians are wrong to believe that jehovah is the supreme deity god the father and that christ came into mortality as his only begotten son mcconkie then stated what mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter he said that elohim is the father and jehovah is the son being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists have gone in defining their three in one god it comes as no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised messiah some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity whose son came into mortality as the only begotten as with their concept that god is a spirit this misinformation about the gods of heaven is untrue the fact is and it too is attested by holy writ that elohim is the father and that jehovah is the son who was born into mortality as the lord jesus christ the promised messiah promised messiah p notice that mcconkie said the christians are as wrong about their three in one god and their belief that god is a spirit as they are in their understanding of who elohim and jehovah are before examining mcconkie s attack and its validity we shall read a few more statements by mcconkie and other mormon sources concerning the words elohim and jehovah mcconkie stated the chief designation of christ that has been preserved for us in the old testament as that ancient work is now published is the exalted name title jehovah promised messiah p elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted name title of god the eternal father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being god above all gods mormon doctrine p agreeing with mcconkie on the question of who elohim and jehovah are the apostle james e talmage stated elohim as understood and used in the restored church of jesus christ is the name title of god the eternal father whose firstborn son in the spirit is jehovah the only begotten in the flesh jesus christ jesus the christ p a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve apostles of the mormon church states that god the eternal father is designate d by the exalted name title elohim articles of faith p christ in his preexistent antemortal or unembodied state was known as jehovah articles of faith p today mormon leaders teach that elohim in the ot refers to god the father and jehovah refers to christ mcconkie attacked christians for saying jehovah can refer to the father he stressed that these two name titles should not be changed around so that christ is called elohim and the father is called jehovah the father is elohim not jehovah jehovah is christ and christ is jehovah they are one and the same person promised messiah p in the ot of the kjv of the bible the hebrew word elohim is used to refer to the true god false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel when referring to the true god elohim is translated with a capital g when referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel it is translated with a small g it is translated four times as judges exod once as judge sam twice as mighty gen exod once as angels ps once as godly mal once as great gen and once as very great sam the word jehovah is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel points taken from the word adonai many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was yahweh or yahveh however since jehovah rather than yahweh is the word used by mormonism this section will also use jehovah instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of mormon leaders regarding that name jehovah unlike elohim is never used of false gods it is the personal name of the triune god of the bible in the kjv jehovah is rendered primarily lord sometimes god and rarely lord now that we understand something about the words elohim and jehovah and their use by mormon leaders we shall consider the apostle mcconkie s attack on christians for believing the father is jehovah in trying to prove that jehovah refers exclusively to christ mcconkie cited several verses from the bible some of these verses and mcconkie s interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right remember mcconkie said the father is not jehovah he is only elohim the first example we shall consider involves mcconkie s interpretation of ps of this verse he stated of whom spake david when his tongue was touched by the holy spirit and he testified the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool ps two lords are here involved one is speaking to the other one is greater than the other one is making provision for the triumph and glory of the other who are they and what message is contained in this messianic prophecy what think ye of christ our lord asked certain of his detractors toward the end of his mortal ministry whose son is he is christ the son of god or of someone else is he to be born of a divine parent or will he be as other men a mortal son of a mortal father that he was to be a descendant of david was a matter of great pride to all the jews and so they answered the son of david david s son truly he was but he was more much more and so our lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture asked how then doth david in spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool if david then call him lord how is he his son that is if he is only the son of david how is it that the great king acting under inspiration calls him lord and worships him as such and we might add who is the other lord the one who spake unto david s lord can there be any question as to how jesus is interpreting the words of the psalm he is saying that it means the father said unto the son elohim said unto jehovah sit thou on my right hand until after your mortal ministry then i will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever promised messiah pp emphasis added agreeing with the above statement by mcconkie the following remark in the mormon pamphlet what the mormons think of christ p reads the lord elohim the father said unto my lord jehovah the son brackets in original mcconkie clearly stated that it is elohim the father who is speaking to jehovah the son in this psalm however when one looks at the hebrew word translated lord it becomes apparent that either the first lord is not the father or else the father is jehovah either way mcconkie is wrong the psalm reads the lord jehovah said unto my lord adon sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool ps the first lord in this verse is jehovah who mormonism says is christ not the father the second lord is the hebrew word adon singular for adonai meaning master or lord if the first lord is the father and the second lord is the son then the father is jehovah and the son is adon however if the father is not jehovah as mcconkie claimed then the first lord is jehovah the son but who then is adon obviously the father is jehovah in this psalm and his son is adon another example involves isa about which mcconkie stated the following i the lord have called thee in righteousness isaiah quoted the father as saying of christ and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles isa promised messiah p emphasis added mcconkie said the father was speaking of christ in this passage which reads i the lord jehovah have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles isa according to mcconkie i the lord refers to the father and thine and thee refer to christ however the lord who is speaking is jehovah which means either mcconkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the father is jehovah another example involves ps of these verses mcconkie stated the same psalm says all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him ps the fulfillment as jesus hung on the cross is found in these words the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth matt promised messiah pp emphasis added ps reads as follows all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord jehovah that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him mcconkie said these verses had their fulfillment as jesus hung on the cross that means the person who was scorned in these verses was christ who then was the lord in whom he trusted it was jehovah the father another example involves ps and ps regarding them mcconkie stated the following with reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our lord s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life ps as to the role of judas in those conspiracies the psalmist says mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me ps promised messiah p apostle mcconkie said these psalms refer to christ s arrest and judicial trials we shall first consider ps and then ps while mcconkie only quoted verse of ps verse will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life but i trusted in thee o lord jehovah i said thou art my god elohim ps mcconkie said verse referred to jesus christ verse goes on to tell that he christ trusted in the lord who is called his god or elohim mormonism teaches that the god above jesus is elohim the father verse however reveals that the elohim of the man jesus is jehovah the father in ps mcconkie only quoted one verse however two verses will be considered in this examination yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me but thou o lord jehovah be merciful unto me and raise me up that i may requite them ps mcconkie stated above that verse referred to judas role in christ s death since it was judas who was the familiar friend who lifted up his heel the pronouns mine i my and me in verse must refer to christ notice that at the beginning of verse there is a change of pronoun to thou which refers to the lord jehovah then the pronouns me and i which refer to christ are used again that means christ was speaking to jehovah the father in these verses another example involves mcconkie s following remark about ps one of the great messianic prophecies spoken by the mouth of david says the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek ps promised messiah p mcconkie admitted this is a messianic prophecy involving christ the question is what in this verse refers to christ the lord jehovah hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek ps does the lord which is jehovah refer to christ if mcconkie is right and jesus is jehovah but the father is not then the lord would have to refer to christ but who then is the one addressed as the priest forever after the order of melchizedek the bible reveals that the one referred to is jesus christ heb therefore the lord jehovah in ps is the father another example involves isa of these verses mcconkie stated of the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah isaiah said the lord has laid on him the iniquities of us all it pleased the lord to bruise him promised messiah p emphasis added mcconkie rightly said these verses refer to the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah however what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the father is jehovah verse reads all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord jehovah hath laid on him christ the iniquity of us all and verse reads yet it pleased the lord jehovah to bruise him christ obviously the lord who laid on christ the iniquity of us all and who bruised him is god the father who is called jehovah in these verses remember mcconkie stated that some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity and that christ came into mortality as his only begotten son he called this concept misinformation that is untrue to prove that it is mcconkie who is misinformed and believing untruth two scriptural references sam ps will be examined mcconkie stated the following regarding these scriptures in the midst of a passage that is clearly messianic the lord says of the seed of david i will be his father and he shall be my son sam in the second psalm the whole of which is also clearly messianic occurs this statement thou art my son this day have i begotten thee ps paul quotes both of these statements in hebrews and says they are prophecies that christ would come as the son of god promised messiah p mcconkie cited heb to show that sam and ps refer to christ who would come as the son of god since mcconkie first referenced sam this examination will too however along with verse verses will also be included and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the lord jehovah telleth thee that he will make thee an house and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever i will be his father and he shall be my son sam these verses teach that the lord jehovah would have a son the messiah in the second example mcconkie cited ps this examination will include verse notice that it is the lord jehovah who says thou art my son this day have i begotten thee i will declare the decree the lord jehovah hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession mcconkie said these verses of scripture are clearly messianic and he acknowledged they teach that christ would come as the son of god what he is not willing to acknowledge however is that these scriptures also teach that the father is jehovah and that the sectarians who believe jehovah is the supreme deity whose son is jesus christ the only begotten are right in their belief another example involves mic of this verse mcconkie stated the following and so truly did our lord act during his mortal ministry truly this is he of whom it is written he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord in the majesty of the name of the lord his god for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth mic promised messiah p emphasis added according to mcconkie the pronoun he at the beginning of mic refers to christ during his mortal ministry who then is the lord his god mic reads and he christ shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord jehovah in the majesty of the name of the lord jehovah his god elohim for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth obviously the lord of jesus christ is jehovah the father who is referred to as jehovah his elohim another example involves ps and isa of these verses mcconkie stated the following a number of messianic passages speak of the lord and his anointed ps signifying that the chosen one was consecrated and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his jesus applied these passages to himself by quoting isaiah s prophecy the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek isa and then saying this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears luke promised messiah pp emphasis added the first source mcconkie quoted ps reads as follows the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord jehovah and against his anointed mcconkie said the anointed one was christ if that is true who was jehovah if jehovah is always christ who was the anointed one obviously jehovah is referring to god the father and the anointed is indeed referring to christ the second source mcconkie cited is isa which states the spirit of the lord adonai god jehovah is upon me because the lord jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound the one who was anointed to preach bind up proclaim and open was jesus christ who then was the one who anointed him this verse says the lord jehovah did the anointing again we face the same problem if jehovah does not refer to the father but only to christ then jesus anointed someone but who as mcconkie pointed out jesus applied these passages to himself therefore the jehovah who anointed christ is god the father other examples could be cited to show that mcconkie and other mormon leaders are wrong when they say god the father is not jehovah however these should be enough to expose their error now what about mormonism s claim that jesus is jehovah but he is not elohim it is true that jesus is jehovah the following scriptures prove this fact thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god isa jesus said i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead rev saith the lord jehovah they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son zech behold he christ cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him rev i am the lord jehovah thy god the holy one of israel isa ye denied the holy one christ and the just acts and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord jehovah shall be delivered joel the name of jesus christ of nazareth there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts behold the lord god jehovah will come with strong hand his reward is with him isa behold i christ come quickly and my reward is with me rev the lord jehovah my god shall come and all the saints with thee zech at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints thess the lord jehovah is my shepherd ps jesus said i am the good shepherd john saith the lord god jehovah i will seek that which was lost ezek the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost luke for i am the lord jehovah thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour isa looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ tit see also jer and rev mal and heb kin and john isa and tim ps and matt prov and rev while mormons are right when they say jesus is jehovah they are wrong when they say he is not elohim the bible reveals that jehovah is the only true elohim there is all others are false remember jehovah is the personal name of the triune god who has revealed himself in the bible before we consider biblical quotes which show that jehovah and elohim are not two separate gods as mormons claims let us first note that not only are both god the father and christ addressed as jehovah and elohim but so is the holy spirit whereof the holy ghost said this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more heb emphasis on holy ghost and said added behold the days come saith the lord jehovah that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god elohim and they shall be my people i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more jer emphasis added for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost pet emphasis on holy ghost added the spirit of the lord jehovah spake by me and his word was in my tongue sam see also heb with ps let us now continue with the biblical quotes which show that jehovah and elohim are not two separate gods as mormons claim and when the lord jehovah saw that he moses turned aside to see god elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i bruce r mcconkie acknowledged that it was christ s voice that spoke to moses in the burning bush promised messiah p and the lord jehovah said and moses said unto god elohim behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god elohim of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god elohim said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you and god elohim said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord jehovah god elohim of your fathers the god elohim of abraham the god elohim of isaac and the god elohim of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations exod and god elohim spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord jehovah exod i am the lord jehovah and there is none else there is no god elohim beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me isa but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim he is the living god elohim and an everlasting king jer thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god elohim isa therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus saith the lord jehovah whose name is the god elohim of hosts amos behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lord s jehovah s thy god elohim the earth also with all that therein is deut wherefore thou art great o lord jehovah god elohim for there is none like thee neither is there any god elohim beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears sam and he said unto them i am an hebrew and i fear the lord jehovah the god elohim of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land jon for who is god elohim save the lord jehovah or who is a rock save our god elohim ps blessed is the nation whose god elohim is the lord jehovah ps see also ps hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god elohim the lord jehovah the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding isa the mighty god elohim even the lord jehovah hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof ps sing unto god elohim sing praises to his name estol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name jah and rejoice before him ps regarding the word jah bruce r mcconkie stated jah hebrew yah is a contracted form of jehovah jahveh or yahweh all of which names have reference to christ the god of israel mormon doctrine p and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god elohim whose name is called by the name of the lord jehovah of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims sam the great the mighty god elohim the lord jehovah of hosts is his name jer o my god elohim make them like a wheel as the stubble before the wind fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o lord jehovah that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art the most high over all the earth ps the bible clearly teaches that jehovah is elohim in fact he is the only elohim there is he is the true the living the mighty the great and the everlasting elohim he is the elohim of israel of all the kingdoms of the earth and of the heavens he is the creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon jehovah s name is elohim of hosts amos not only is jehovah elohim but elohim is jehovah the bible reveals that elohim s name is jah ps jehovah ps and jehovah of hosts sam jer the nation whose elohim is jehovah is blessed ps clearly this is not the jehovah and elohim of the mormons another mormon error regarding elohim and jehovah is the belief that elohim not jehovah is the father of all the spirits including jesus in the articles of faith by apostle james e talmage a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve apostles states that god the eternal father elohim is the literal parent of the spirits of the human race p this doctrinal exposition also states explicitly that jesus christ is not the father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth for he is one of them he is the son as they are sons and daughters of elohim p the apostle talmage stated that elohim is the name title of god the eternal father whose firstborn son in the spirit is jehovah jesus the christ p the apostle bruce r mcconkie stated the following about this matter jehovah christ did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof but when it came to placing man on earth there was a change in creators that is the father himself became personally involved all things were created by the son using the power delegated by the father except man in the spirit and again in the flesh man was created by the father there was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned promised messiah p emphasis added mormon leaders claim that jehovah christ did not create either man s spirit or his body they maintain that the mormon elohim who is the father created man both in spirit and body the bible reveals the truth about who created man and moses spake unto the lord jehovah saying let the lord jehovah the god elohim of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the congregation num see also emphasis added the lord jehovah which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him zech emphasis added the lord jehovah made us this soul jer for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made saith the lord jehovah isa emphasis on souls i have made added behold i am the lord jehovah the god elohim of all flesh jer emphasis added thus saith the lord jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord jehovah that maketh all things isa emphasis added thus saith the lord jehovah i have made the earth and created man upon it isa emphasis added god elohim created man upon the earth unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord jehovah he is god elohim there is none else beside him deut thus saith god el the lord jehovah he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein isa thus saith the lord jehovah of hosts the god elohim of israel i have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the ground jer most emphasis added the bible reveals that it is jehovah who is the elohim of the spirits of all flesh and of all flesh itself that it was he who formed the spirit of man within him that he made us this soul and formed us from the womb he did indeed create man if mormon leaders are right when they say jesus is jehovah then they are wrong when they say he did not create man if they are right when they say the father is the one who created man then they are wrong when they say he is not jehovah although mormon leaders teach that jesus did not create man mormon scriptures teach that he did the bom states the following behold i am jesus christ i am the father and the son and never have i showed myself unto man whom i have created for never has man believed in me as thou hast behold this body which ye now behold is the body of my spirit and man have i created after the body of my spirit eth emphasis added for it is i that taketh upon me the sins of the world for it is i that hath created them mos emphasis added the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob is that same god who created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them are behold he created adam mor emphasis added d c states that the worlds were made by him christ men were made by him all things were made by him and through him and of him emphasis added another error by bruce r mcconkie involving jehovah and his creation is the belief that jehovah had many pre mortal spirits helping him create included in this alleged group was joseph smith jr that he christ was aided in the creation of this earth by many of the noble and great spirit children of the father is evident from abraham s writings unto those superior spirits christ said we will go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell abra michael or adam was one of these enoch noah abraham moses peter james and john joseph smith and many other noble and great ones played a part in the great creative enterprise doctrines of salvation vol pp mormon doctrine p the bible reveals the truth about this matter thus saith the lord jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord jehovah that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself isa which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea job jehovah by himself created all things he had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting him regarding the mormon elohim the apostle mcconkie stated elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted name title of god the eternal father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being god above all gods mormon doctrine p he also stated that jesus is above all save the father only promised messiah p the bible states that the one who is god above all so called gods is the triune god jehovah for the lord jehovah is a great god el and a great king above all gods elohim ps for thou lord jehovah art high above all the earth thou art exalted far above all gods elohim ps now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all gods elohim exod see also ps deut if mormon leaders are right when they say jehovah is god the son and elohim is god the father these verses from the bible would be teaching that the mormon son is above his father however as mcconkie clearly stated mormons believe elohim the father not jehovah the son is the god above all gods that jesus is above all except the father yet the bible teaches that jehovah is above all elohim at a byu dev on march bruce r mcconkie made the following remark about praying to jesus another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed this is plain sectarian nonsense our prayers are addressed to the father and to him only perfect prayer is addressed to the father in the name of the son it is uttered by the power of the holy ghost our relationship with the lord pp mcconkie states on p of his book promised messiah that the mormons pray to the father not the son on p of the same book mcconkie states that christ the son is jehovah this is important to remember because although mcconkie said prayer is not to be offered to the mormon christ who is jehovah the bible states repeatedly in the ot that people prayed to jehovah and he not only heard those prayers but he accepted them as valid requests the following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to jehovah in my distress i called upon the lord jehovah and cried unto my god elohim he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears ps and the lord jehovah said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually kin and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the lord jehovah thy god elohim even for all this remnant jer o lord jehovah i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name neh and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord jehovah he arose from before the altar of the lord jehovah from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven kin he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the lord jehovah kin go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord jehovah the god elohim of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years isa i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord jehovah and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found ps notice above in ps that the godly pray to jehovah according to mcconkie and other mormon leaders that is christ the very one to whom mcconkie said people should not pray the bible reveals there is only one true elohim and his name is jehovah all other elohim are false they are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true elohim and idolatry for the lord jehovah is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods elohim for all the gods elohim of the nations are idols but the lord jehovah made the heavens ps thou shalt have no other gods elohim before me exod now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all gods elohim exod and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god elohim and walk after other gods elohim and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish deut thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods elohim they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me for if thou serve their gods elohim it will surely be a snare unto thee exod take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods elohim and worship them deut that ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods elohim nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them josh neither walk after other gods elohim to your hurt jer but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim he is the living god elohim jer and they forsook the lord jehovah god elohim of their fathers which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods elohim of the gods elohim of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the lord jehovah to anger jud shall a man make gods elohim unto himself and they are no gods elohim therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the lord jehovah jer and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord jehovah choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods elohim which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods elohim of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord jehovah and the people answered and said god elohim forbid that we should forsake the lord jehovah to serve other gods elohim josh these verses teach that the only true living elohim in heaven and on earth is jehovah the triune god who made heaven and earth and all therein jehovah is greater than any elohim because all other elohim are idols the reality behind them is demonic deut jehovah elohim has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false elohim he told his people not to have any elohim but him he told the people that if they left him for the false elohim those elohim would be a snare to them and they would be hurt and would perish he warned the people to take heed that their heart be not deceived into worshiping serving swearing by and making covenants with false elohim jehovah elohim told his people he would eventually judge all false elohim and their followers despite these warnings and guidelines elohim s covenant people forsook him and believed in and worshiped the false elohim s of the people they came in contact with ju states that the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord jehovah and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods elohim of syria and the gods elohim of zidon and the gods elohim of moab and the gods elohim of the children of ammon and the gods elohim of the philistines and forsook the lord jehovah and served not him this examination has shown that the elohim of mormonism like the elohim in ju is not the true jehovah elohim therefore the people who leave the true elohim for the mormon elohim will do evil in the sight of the lord jehovah although mcconkie attacked christians for their belief in a triune god who is spirit and for their belief that god the father jehovah sent his son into the world these beliefs are true god is triune he is spirit he is jehovah and he did send his son into the world to redeem mankind it is obvious from this examination that it is not the christians who thrash around in darkness about who elohim and jehovah are one wonders what holy writ mcconkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that elohim is the father and that jehovah is the son he certainly did not mean the bible which teaches that the father son and holy spirit are all the one jehovah elohim he apparently did not mean the d c either because chapter verses refer to the father as jehovah summary obviously joseph fielding smith s statement that the mormons have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of god doctrines of salvation is not accurate the mormon gods are not the true god as mormonism claims but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against god and idolatry in answer to jesus question but whom say ye that i am mormons say jesus is someone different from the jesus who is revealed in the bible and whom the apostles preached therefore anyone trusting in the mormon jesus is believing in another jesus whom paul warned about bernard p brockbank of the first quorum of the seventy admitted in the may issue of the ensign a mormon publication that the mormon jesus is different from the christian jesus he stated that it is true that many of the christian churches worship a different jesus christ than is worshipped by the mormons or the church of jesus christ of latter day saints p the people who believe in the mormon jesus are committing adultery against god and idolatry they do not have the son therefore they do not have the father and they do not have eternal life as the apostle bruce r mcconkie rightly stated salvation comes only by worshiping the true god promised messiah p mcconkie also rightly stated that the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living god because the true names of deity can be applied to false concepts of god mormon doctrine p remember that the apostle stephen l richards admitted that joseph smith jr gave a new conception of god and the godhead contributions of joseph smith p it is important for the people who have left the true triune god revealed in the bible to repent and return to him they must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in mormonism the bible says all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the lord jehovah the fountain of living waters jer and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god elohim and walk after other gods elohim and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish deut thou shalt make no covenant with their gods elohim exod put away the strange gods elohim that are among you and be clean and change your garments gen flee from idolatry cor it is necessary that christians heed the warnings of the bible if they do they will not fall into the sins of adultery against god and idolatry remember to know the only true god is eternal life john their gods elohim shall be a snare unto you ju see also exod,talk.religion.misc

from neese cerritos edu newsgroups talk religion misc subject hell message id apr cerritos edu date apr pst distribution world organization cerritos college norwalk ca lines in the king james version of the bible there are three differents words translated into the word hell these greek words have totally different meanings the words are hades tartaros and gehenna in bibical usage the greek word hades is used only times in the new testament and is roughly the equivalent to the old testament word sheol meaning the grave or pit compare acts with psalms hades may be likened to a hole in the ground in the bible it has nothing to do with fire most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the english word hell to translate hades and sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice why because when seeing the word hell many readers impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever burning inferno when this was never remotely intended in the greek language or in old english in its true bibical usage hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of shadowy realm hades is simply the abode we call the grave all dead go to this hell the second hell of the bible tartaros is mentioned only once in scripture pet for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell tartaros and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment following their rebellion to unseat god from his throne isa rev the archangel lucifer now satan and a third of the created angels now demons were ejected from heaven luke they were cast down to tartaros a place or condition of restraint that god has imposed on the mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment jude cor tartaros then is a hell that applies only to evil rebellious angels or demons it is interesting that the ancient greeks used this word to describe the place in which zeus confined the rebellious titans nowhere in the bible is there any mention of men being put into this particular hell the the third word that is translated as hell in the bible is gehenna it comes from the hebrew gai hinnom meaning valley of hinniom hinnom is a deep narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of jerusalem in old testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites including infant sacrifice it was there that the apostate kings ahaz and manasseh made their children pass through the fire to the god molech the rites were specifically celebrated in tophet the place of abhorrence one of the chief groves in the valley king josiah of ancient judah finally put an end to these abominations he defiled the valley rendering it ceremonially unclean kings later the valley became the cesspool and city dump of jerusalem a repository for sewage refuse and animal carcasses the bodies of dispised criminals were also burned there along with the rubbish fires burned continuously feeding by a constant supply of garbage and refuse aceldama the field of blood purchased with the money judas received for the betrayal of christ matt was also in part of the valley of hinnom so what does this valley called gehenna have to do with hell in rev the satan inspired political dictator and a miracle working religious figure the false prophet working with him will resist the re establishment of the government of god by jesus christ at his second coming their fate is revealed by the apostle john and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone where will this temporary lake of fire this hell be the prophet isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the beast for tophet in the valley of hinnom is ordained of old yea for the king it is prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it isa one thousand years later satan himself will be cast into this rekindled fiery lake where the beast and false prophet were cast rev but what of the wicked who have died over the millennia does the bible say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of fire in the sequence of rev the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be thrown into the lake of fire after satan is cast there rev what will become of these wicked will they writhe in flames for eternity the wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming gehenna fire on the earth they wil be consumed annihilated destroyed this punishment will be everlasting permanent and final the bible calls it the second death rev from which there is no possibility of a further resurrection the bible does teach eternal punishment but not eternal punishing the prophet malachi provides a graphic description for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up to the righteous god says that the wicked shall be ashes under the soles of your feet mal gehenna was a place of destruction and death not a place of living torture jesus was talking to jews who understood all about this gehenna or valley of hinnom utter destruction by fire was complete nothing was left but ashes every text in the bible translated from this greek word gehenna means complete destruction not living torture not eternal life in torment the bible says in romans the wages of sin is death not eternal life in torture the punishment revealed in the bible is death the cessation of life eternal life is the gift of god,talk.religion.misc

writes why is the nt tossed out as info on jesus i realize it is normally tossed out because it contains miracles but what are the other reasons it is not tossed out as a source but would it be regarded as unbiased and independant bruce hits the main point simply as russell turpin does in more detail in his response all sources are in modern historiography to be used critically which is simply to say that any claims deriving from them are subject to specific examination in the light of motives and other human considerations as well as the physical background the critical method applies both to the original document and to the uses made of it by others most emphatically including the historical researchers themselves wouldn t they be a better reporter than someone who heard about it second hand i guess isn t firsthand better than second hand i know there is bias and winners writing history but doesn t the principle of firsthand being best still apply but given the critical principle what evidence is there that we have anything at all from firsthand sources about jesus paul s letters are indeed firsthand evidence about paul and his interactions they are as a result the most historically solid books in the nt paul s claims and descriptions about his conflicts with jerusalem may not be wie es eigent lich gewesen but they are most definitely the comments of a participant in other words we d evaluate paul s statements more or less as we would the testimony of a witness in court the gospels are another story altogether luke is most assuredly not a firsthand witness he claims to have gathered material that is closer to the actual events but this is a conventional claim in ancient books and luke in fact never names a witness or points to any one thing in his book s which derive from any source we can detect behind luke john has a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloved disciple who is not named we are not bound to accept this claim for a long time some scholars rejected it outright but even if we do it makes the fourth gospel as we have it at best secondhand neither mark nor matthew make any claims to be firsthand later much later christian tradition associates the first gosple with matthew and a possible aramaic proto gospel and associates mark with peter as having something like the same second hand status of recounting peter s preaching of the gospel such traditional claims run into difficulties if we try to evaluate the actual data before us luke and matthew both appear to use differently an anonymous and not otherwise attested collection of logoi words and deeds of jesus as well as to be dependent on mark this makes their testimony at least thirdhand all that said historians do attempt to glean whatever they can from the nt sources and they are overwhelmingly the obvious and best sources for anything about the earliest church they are also extremely important for the light they cast however refracted through christian biases on the sectarian world of judaism just before and around the time of the destruction of the nd temple the problem of the historical jesus is tricky however there is a cycle of fashion on this and we are now near a major high in people thinking they can discern with historico critical plausibility some thing about jesus life and opinions from the nt the difficulty here which dominated thinking years ago and will probably return to favor in another generation was pointed out by bultmann after schweitzer s treatment at the end of the previous high point on the cycle simply because all our sources have passed through at least one layer of quite anonymous shaping within the early church we have no easy and reliable way to distribute any part of the material between real history and the inventions of the church there are few radical skeptics who think we have nothing of history in the gospels though such a position can be maintained but neither have we any tools that can distinguish shaping of real historical material by its communal use as opposed to invention michael l siemon stand stand at the window mls panix com as the tears

writes dpw sei cmu edu david wood writes mlee ra royalroads ca malcolm lee writes these laws written for the israelites god s chosen people whom god had expressly set apart from the rest of the world the israelites were a direct witness to god s existence to disobey god after knowing that god is real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to god s chosen people but jesus has changed all of that we are living in the age of grace sin is no longer immediately punishable by death there is repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ and not just for a few chosen people salvation is available to everyone jew and gentile alike sorry if this is late for the thread but i thought god was supposed to be constant and never changing how do you reconcile this common christian view with the paragraph above god never changes sorry but yes he does by your own description he still loves us sending jesus was one of his attempts to reconcile with mankind humorous this notion of an all knowing all powerful god who must attempt to reconcile with his lowly creations i realize that it is not possible to penetrate such logic but is there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything and further that an attempt to reconcile implies a lack of omniscience what you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god also while we re at it how do you reconcile a kind and loving god with the judeo christian view that sin was at one time immediately punishable by death was killing people for sinning god s way of showing kindness and love sinning in the face of god was punishable by immediate death there are several ot passages to back this up god is god but all humans are sinners thus all pre jesus humans should have been punished with death we aren t punished with sin now of course because god has changed he required a brutal sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death he cannot tolerate the prescence of sin in his midst yet he does so now he has changed the sadistic murder of his own son has made him more tolerant of our sins besides his midst is everywhere so your statement is meaningless he tolerates sin in hell which surely is in his midst as well also given that he is all knowing he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sins as well as when and where so what does tolerance have to do with anything all of this is absolute nonsense unless your god is not indeed all knowing and all powerful or unless he doesn t take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you claim and the israelites knew this and still some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed were these people kind and loving themselves not relevant the claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in reference to your god the nature of his creations victims is not at issue god gave them every break he could but in the end he really had no choice in the matter i see an all knowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome would be and an all powerful god who had no choice in the matter mindmush seeing as how we were failing to achieve salvation on our own he sent his son to die for us to be the ultimate sin offering did i miss something did you give some indication at to why a kind and loving god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his own botched creations to achieve salvation is the fact the he no longer does this an admission on his part of having made a mistake he sent his son as a consolation to us out of love i note that your answer physically follows my question but i fail to discern a connection between the two by the way for what am i being consoled now that we are living in the age of grace does this mean that for our sins god now damns us to eternal hell after we die rather than killing us immediately if so is this eternal damnation an example of a kind and loving god hey let s be fair for a moment here kind and loving does not mean a free ride why not by the way i note for the record that you didn t answer the questions there is an amount of give and take as in any relationship parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that children can do whatever they want not part of being a parent means administering punishment when the child is at fault death and or eternal damnation is your idea of correctional punishment i hope you aren t a parent part of being a parent means giving instruction god tests us through the trial of life such that we may grow stronger he teaches what is right and what is wrong this is quite an elaborate fantasy that you ve constructed but sadly it lacks a basis in reality it also does not address the questions that i raised the consequences of our actions are made clear to us be it heaven or be it hell if god did not follow through with what he has warned us about he would not be a very good parent the god that you describe is not a good parent but a tyrant in parenting if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through with it the children will not take that parent s words very seriously god does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and what not to do by life s trials we see the folly of doing our own will rather than his he warns us about the consequences of rejecting him when it comes time for judgement sorry was that the god of the bible whose rules i am to follow or the god of the koran the vedas

tektronix inc wilsonville or lines brian ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of false dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to peter or we must discount every other book of antiquity peter died two millenia ago the original letters he wrote have long since decayed into dust if he were alive today and i could do you question the existence of alexander the great tilgrath pilisar iii nero caligula josephus cyrus the great artexerxes their documents have decayed to dust too brian why another excuse mr ceccarelli you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every historical document somehow i doubt do that yourself that thus since i doubt you accept everything written in every historical document i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to peter i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity which i am sure you reject it dates from the time of ramses ii this was first presented here by matthew wiener these inscriptions were carved soon after a battle and were carved with the pharoah s specific approval so we have true originals rather than mere copies this account records the the battle of kadesh circa bc which occurred on the river orontes about miles south of aleppo the egyptians won this battle with the hittites and ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place a few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form it is a record of how the pharoah pretty much single handedly defeated the hittites after being separated from his troops note that the egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person the following is from miriam lichtheim s ancient egyptian literature volume ii my majesty caused the forces of the foes from hitti to fall on their faces one upon the other as crocodiles fall into the water of the orontes i was after them like a griffin i attacked all the countries i alone for my infantry and my chariotry had deserted me not one of them stood looking back as i live as ra loves me as my father atum favors me everything that my majesty has told i did it in truth in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry note this paragraph records not only ramses divine word but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event now from the heart of battle then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces of the foe from hitti being alone by himself none other with him his majesty proceeded to look about him and found chariots ringing him on his way out no officer was with me no charioteer no soldier of the army no shield bearer my infantry my chariotry yielded before them not one of them stood firm to fight with them his majesty spoke what is this father amun is it right for a father to ignore his son are my deeds a matter for you to ignore do i not walk and stand at your word i have not neglected an order you gave too great is he the great lord of egypt to allow aliens to step on his path what are these asiatics to you o amun the wretches ignorant of god have i not made for you many great monuments i call to you my father amun i am among a host of strangers all countries are arrayed against me i am alone there s none with me the labors of many people are nothing amun is more helpful than they i came here by the command of your mouth o amun i have not transgressed your command now though i prayed in a distant land my voice resounded in southern thebes i found amun came when i called to him he gave me his hand and i rejoiced he called from behind as if near by forward i am with you i your father my hand is with you i prevail over a hundred thousand men i am lord of victory lover of valor i found my heart stout my breast in joy all i did succeeded i was like mont i slaughtered among them at my will not one looked behind him not one turned around whoever fell down did not rise one called out to the other saying no man is he who is among us it is seth great of strength baal in person not deeds of man are these his doings they are of one who is unique who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots come quick flee before him to seek life and breathe air for he who attempts to get close to him his hands all his limbs grow limp one cannot hold either bow or spears when one sees him come racing along my majesty hunted them like a griffin i slaughtered among them unceasingly so you see brian we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous battle between the ramses and the hittites do you reject them as being completely true i suspect you do and if so then do you also in your own words question the existence of alexander the great tilgrath pilisar iii nero caligula josephus cyrus the great artexerxes do you also thereby question all their documents that s the problem with your all or nothing approach many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy with their facts so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter and the rest of the new testament or accept no records of antiquity at all forces you thereby to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find completely credible as to your other argument that so many people have testified to jesus that he must be true are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from shepherds to irs agents to royal officials to kings to computer programmers fiction with a scoff of your keyboard with near complete ignorance of the testimonies are you going to say that that is all complete hooey would that not be the most audacious display of arrogance do you actually think you know better than king solomon king david or even abraham lincoln i have three points first this is argumentum ad populum ie appeal to popular opinion you cannot vote on truth for instance do the millions of hindu s past and present who testify to the reality of brahma constitute actual evidence for the existence of brahma how would you answer your own question in regards to the testimony of hindus with a scoff of your keyboard with near complete ignorance of the testimonies are you going to say that that is all complete hooey if you do so scoff then how do you objectively justify your own special pleading second it is not at all clear that king solomon or king david testified to jesus you can claim it to be clear but that does not make it true third it is quite arguable that abraham lincoln was not christian and that he had both a public and a private view of christianity in fact there was much discussion about it in his day yes he was publically accused of being a deist oh my i am presently collecting a faq for lincoln as i ve previously done for tyre jefferson and etc later dave butler my earlier views of the unsoundness of the christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scriptures have become clearer and stronger with advancing years and i see no reason for thinking i shall ever change them abraham lincoln to judge j s wakefield after the death of willie lincoln,talk.religion.misc

perfect and we do not end perfect either we are never perfect can you name one person young or old past or present that you deem perfect good luck i know my shortcomings and i know my strengths and i live my life according to the decisions i make and i am content to abide with the consequences of my decisions as easily as i ll accept the praise for them there have been times in my life when i ve made mistakes yes i try to never make the same mistake twice then you lie to yourself you do not know your shortcomings i have clearly shown one of your shortcomings if not two that is ignorance of the bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its contents i regard christ as a myth because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself and to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion i bet you do not even know what the word christ means or which prophet used christ to describe the son of man i feel that there are far too many people offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and did the only person who can really judge me is me yes i agree with that so we must learn first read the bible come up with our own interpretation evaluate what is being said and by whom check the history books as well compare someone else s interpretation with your own then make a judgment but i tell you the truth of what is being said in the bible needs interpretation as much as a coffee cup needs interpretation and remember the bible isn t a guru s esoteric guide to metaphysics it doesn t take a theologian to understand what is being said the bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and i addressed to people like you and i these guys wrote down what they saw and heard is it their open diary and they want to tell you something and because they want you to know something they make it very clear what they want you to know they didn t encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric but in simple straight forward language i choose the roads i travel and i decide whether or not i want to reach the end of any given road or turn back and as long as i don t always turn back there s no shame in it when i need help i seek out my friends you have chosen the road that avoids the bible you have chosen the road that avoids a confrontation with the living god because that road doesn t look appealing to you you rather build your own road one that goes far away from that confrontation but be assured of this you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly and you don t have a clue about what i m saying either open your eyes and see open your ears and listen i m not just spouting off empty words this is my life this is what gives me meaning i see what you mean i hear what your saying i am not degrading your life but i have heard the same irrational excuses for years there is nothing new in what you are saying and by your own words you are spouting off contradictions if contradictions give you meaning then your life must be sad i say my mother loves me how do i know you ask i can point to definite things she s done for me and i can even just bring her to you so you can ask her face to face you say your deity loves you how do you know i ask bingo for god so loved the world he gave his only begotton to son so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life i look what god did he has given his son even to his death so that i can have hope in his resurrection and know that life isn t for nothing but has glorious purpose you can t even convince me that it exists because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history you choose to lie to yourself that he doesn t exist for you ignore what has been said for thousands of years you sound exactly almost verbatim like the lazarus of jesus s story starting in luke and the conclusion of that story is a bleak one lazarus wound up in hell the story ends like this for if lazarus doesn t even listen to moses and the prophets he won t even believe if a man rose from the dead if any god dangles heaven before me like a carrot promising untold pleasures to me if i ll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once then i would choose hell i can not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful it is arrogance at its best the fact is you are not rational several specific cases have already been cited and again with this new statement you show more irrationality with regards to heaven jesus does tell you something of what to expect in heaven jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him jesus does not expect you to placate either jesus wants you to willingly come to him but not as his grovelling slave but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious riches why do you not pick up the bible and read it for yourself you maintain you have an open mind see whether you are lying to yourself for yourself why would you want to live a good life to you you die and that s it don t contradict yourself you have no reason to live a good life it doesn t do you any good in the end your life doesn t do anybody else any good either because everyone dies anyway so you have no reason to lead a good life leading a good life is meaningless why do you do such a meaningless thing that paragraph demonstrates that you haven t listened to a single word i ve said i do understand what you said but that s is not what i feel went amiss here you missed the point living a good life has no eternal consequences once they close the amusement park of life to you that is the end to you it is over to you therefore your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless it has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth but then you contradict yourself from a previous post you said doing evil things is bad to you it shouldn t matter if you do evil things or good things it is all meaningless in the end anyway so go rob a bank go tell someone you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag what s restraining you life after all has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant in the same way i think life is fun and i don t intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night d at which time you are truly not the master of yourself i m sorry i don t feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god i d worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case it s not really all that important has the resurrection sunk in jesus is alive jesus is not dead so you and your holy book say by the same token therefore santa claus delivers toys every xmas don t you see i have no reason to believe that what you say is true please give me some reason that i can t similarly apply to santa claus you have every reason to believe that what jesus says and the witnesses of jesus say are true but you choose to be unreasonable and ignore the reasons by definition ignorance santa claus is said to live at the north pole and have a squad of elves and flying reindeer ever see a flying reindeer has anyone in human history seen a flying reindeer has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose blinks red on the other hand are people born in bethlehem was nebuchandezzar really a king was daniel really one of his court officials were david and solomon really kings of

the scientific american i suppose you treat both with equal truthfulness or equal falsity is this what you are telling me or is it that just do want to read the scientific american and find out that

organization mantis consultants cambridge uk x newsreader rusnews v lines frank d s uucp frank o dwyer writes in article q rusnews w w mantis co uk mathew mathew mantis co uk writes got it in one similarly a moral relativist will not judge one moral syste to be better than another in every possible circumstance this does not however preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than anothe in a specific set of circumstances nor does it preclude a set of moral relativists from collectively judging a moral system from some set of circumstances which they all agree they are in o k this makes sense to me i m serious you ve explained something to me which i never understood before but just for grins suppose we almost all agree that we are in a set of circumstances called reality what then then we all live happily ever after seriously if we all agreed on the circumstances we re in i suspect we d all agree on the best course of action unfortunately i have no confidence that such a situation will ever arise some of us think there s a big god in the sky some don t some think they ve been chosen by god others disagree some think they are infallible others think otherwise until those disagreements over circumstances can be ironed out there s little hope of everyone agreeing or say for all practical intents and purposes there is no frame of reference in which thus and such is good isn t that approximately objective in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to outrun a snail yes i think that for example only a vanishingly small number of people would hold that there s a frame of reference in which gassing six million jews is good so that s probably about as close to an objective moral value as i ve encountered in my life so far for example if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area isn t it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act even though there conceivably might be some tail end case that would justify it well i think your example s poor if the bomb s in iraq for example and was dropped by an american plane many people would hold that it was a moral act and what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if it isn t an objective reality for values i m sorry i can t parse an objective reality for values could you tr y again s an objective reality for values some values are real even in the face of disagreement i still don t quite see what you re trying to say i assume by values you mean moral values yes in which case what do you mean by real what is a real moral value as opposed to an unreal one i mean to say that values are as real as horses whatever you understand by a horse being real is pretty much what i mean about a value being real hmm so these moral values have a perceptible physical presence if you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in your opinion then all you get is infinite regress sorry but in what way is it an infinite regress it looks extremely finite to me i meant that it s never more than your opinion right and the chain ends right there the buck stops with me it s not an infinite regress you ve clarified this for me above my understanding is now that if a supermajority of relativists agree that thus and such is wrong in almost any or all frames of reference then they re saying something which is to all practical intents and purposes no different than what i m saying right the key point however is that there are vanishingly few of these moral issues where we can get of people to agree on the outcome for all frames of reference and agree on the frames of reference what you do not get is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace sorry but that s not so i can provide a justification for asserting that the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace i just can t provide a justification which works in all possible circumstances logically possible or actually possible i can t manage either killing hitler using a car bomb would have been a terrorist act but i have to admit that i couldn t exactly condemn it although there are tricky philosophical issues to do with hindsight by which i mean are you stretching possible to include events such as the atoms in my terminal switching places so that the terminal turns upside down or do you think it likely that circumstances will arise in which terrorism is superior to peace i think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have been better than peace better in terms of numbers of innocent people killed assuming it was successful terrorism of course mathew,talk.religion.misc

writes ra robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying ra things like it is held that cf kermit thread on what ra exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox orthodox is a compound word it comes from orthos straight true right and from doxa opinion doctrine teaching i use orthodox to refer to right teaching as opposed to universal or catholic or foursquare gosple i think that the greek orthodox church would take high offense at your misuse of the word your version of christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived you make claims of bible centricity that are not derivable soley from the bible about six seven months ago you claimed that your primary objection to the lds was that our doctrine was not bible derived and now this and other claims can be shown are also not bible interpeting bible right teaching is derived from letting god speak to us through the bible this can be from reading simple truths in the scriptures and by using the bible to interpret the bible simple truths oh for example ra who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant i think that it is apparent from reading the scriptures that are pertinent luke records christ s promise to the repentant thief who hung on an adjacent cross truly i say to you today you will be with me in paradise but was it not until later that christ rose from the dead and ascended to heaven if christ himself was not in heaven until sunday how could the repentant thief have been there with him the answer lies in the location of paradise when jesus died apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until easter day paradise exalted to heaven paradise wasn t equal to heaven and now it is yet you claim that peeple can not be exalted to heaven nicht wahr jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and lazarus as abraham s bosom to which the godly beggar lazarus was carried by the angels after his decease luke thus abraham s bosom referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed waited till the day of christ s resurrection when i read the story i found that abraham s bosom wasn t so much a place but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to abraham it was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of hades hebrew sheol reserved for believers who had died in the faith but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of god in heaven until the price of redemption had actually been paid on calvary or even that none would precede the presence of jesus back to glory with the father gee this is fairly close to what the lds call spirit prison and what you have called false doctrine doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of jesus and the repentant thief repaired after they each died on friday afternoon but on sunday after the risen christ had first appeared to mary magdalene john and her two companions matthew presumably he then took up with him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise including abraham lazarus and the repentant thief we read in ephesians concerning christ ascending on high he led captivity captive he gave gifts unto men vers deleted reproduced below quoted from the sunspot gopher archive presumably he led the whole band of liberated captives from hades i e the whole population of preresurrection paradise up to the glory of heaven this part is not supported from scripture nor does it support your claim that the paradise where christ descended was exalted making such claims on this little evidence ignores the witness of the scripture sun ephas sun wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity sun captive and gave gifts unto men sun sun x ref psalms sun thou has ascended on hight thout hast led captivity captive thou has sun recieved gifts for men yea for the rebellious aslo that the lord god sun might dwell amoung them sun sun ephas sun now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first sun into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same sun also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all sun things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and sun some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the sun perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the sun edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of sun the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man sun unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ that we sun henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about sun with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning sun craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the sun truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison is now changed from a pre easter postion to post easter by god postion is not supportable makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here ra whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is ra challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ra look at the bible in order to see the truth but what of those who ra see biblical things differently from you i think that this characterization is faulty whenever my personal interpretation is questioned i usually give a reason yes and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading of the scriptures you have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural proof need to be cross checked the referencs that you supply often do not support your postion if they are read in the context of the scripture as for those that see things differently please put forward where there is a valid difference and we can discuss it i seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one views the bible is somehow legitimate except or course for the stuff that i glean from it put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can have a discussion on that topic but to decry something that i put forward without putting forward something else to discuss and to dismiss what i put forward while giving credence to other alleged

writes since everywhere i look zoroaster is suggested as being a probable descendant of daniel suppose you prove he wasn t zoroaster is far older than daniel if anything one could claim that in a sense daniel is a descendant of zoroaster as daniel though being hebrew has assimilated into zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the tanakh of judaism however the majority of the book is in hellenistic aramaic not babylonian aramaic and only has kethuvim or writing status ref encyclopedia of religion mircea eliade daniel or in hebrew daniyye l hero of the biblical book that bears his name daniel is presented as a jew in the babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion s pit he also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of israel s restoration to national religious autonomy as a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court described in daniel written in the third person daniel per forms his interpretations alone while as a visionary apocalyptist in daniel written in the first person he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future it is likely that the name daniel is pseudonymous a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition ez the authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language daniel a and are written in hebrew whereas daniel b is in aramaic the language division parallels the subject division daniel concerns legends and dream interpretations concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies the overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances daniel is chiliastically related suggest an attempt at redactional unity after the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion a chronological ordering is discernable a sequence from king nebuchadrezzar to darius is reported dn much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic for example daniel speaks of nebuchadrezzar s transformation into a beast a story that is reported in the qumran scrolls of nabonidus belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of babylon although he was never king and darius is called a mede who conquered babylon and is placed before cyrus ii of persia although no such darius is known the medes followed the persians and darius is the name of several persian kings presumably the episodes of daniel depicting a series of monarchical reversals episodes of ritual observances and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the seleucid period late fourth to mid second century bce in order to reinvigorate waning jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith the visions of daniel reporting events from the reign of belshazzar to that of cyrus ii but actually predicting the overthrow of seleucid rule in palestine were collected and published during the reign of antiochus iv prior to the maccabean revolt for it was then beginning in bce that the jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to judaism and their ancestral traditions and many refused to desecrate the statues of moses and endured a martyr s death for their resolute trust in divine dominion all of the visions of daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways for example via images of the enthronement of a god of judgment with a son of man invested with rule this figure was interpreted by jews as michael the archangel and by christians as christ in chapter via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations as in chapter or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies especially those of jeremiah as found in daniel the imagery of the four beasts in chapter paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin is one of the enduring images of the book it sur vived as a prototype of jewish and christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the middle ages the role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete isaac abravanel the scientist isaac newton and the philosopher jean bodin and among the fifth monarchy men of seventeenth century england for example is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups the schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent the encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in daniel contains a remarkable reinterpretation of isaiah regarding the suffering servant of god not as all israel but as the select faithful neither the opening stories about daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt they rather advocate a stance of piety civil disobedience and trustful resignation victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel michael and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto pharisaic group of hasidim or pietists the themes of resistance to oppression freedom of worship preservation of monotheistic integrity the overthrow of historical dominions and the acknowledgement of the god of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour zarathushtra founder of the religion know as zoroastrianism or mazdaism from mazda or ahura mazda the name of the god prophesied by zarathushtra the etymology and history of zarathushtra the avestan and oldest form of the name as uncertain both in various iranian languages and in related forms else where there may have been an old persian form zara ushtra from which the greek form zoroastres may be derived and there may have existed an old iranian form zarat ushtra to which may be linked the middle iranian zrdrwsht several middle persian forms such as zrtwsht and the new persian zardusht we can state with certainty only that the second half of the name ushtra means camel the form zoroaster derived from the greek zoroastres was used traditionally in european culture until the eighteenth century when zarathustra closer to the original and as found in nietzsche came into common use after the rediscovery of the avesta the collection of sacred books of zoroastrianism and the resulting studies in iranian philology see avesta notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of zarathushtra even in western culture the sources available to us are few extremely fragmented and heterogeneous our principle sources are the five gathas songs attributed to zarathushtra himself and included in the yasna section of the avesta gatha ahunavaiti yasna gatha ushtavaiti yasna gatha spentamainyu yasna gatha vokukhshathra yasna and gatha vashishtoishti yasna the last of which was probably written after the prophet s death other sources of considerable albeit varying importance are the younger avesta and the remaining zoroastrian religious literature in particular the pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures ce although the achaemenid inscriptions sixth to fourth centures bce never mention zarathushtra he is mentioned by some greek sources of the time not however by herodotus who seems unaware of him the avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of zarathushtra but the text is useful in an indirect way as it clearly implies that the environment in which zoroastrianism arose was not that of iran under the medes or the persians the greek sources on the other hand do provide some information concerning the time of zarathushtra although from a historical point of view they are unreliable some place him six thousand years before the trojan war xanthus of lydia eudoxus of cnidus hermippus hermodorus aristotle plutarch diogenes laertius and pliny the account by xanthus of lydia however has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred rather than six thousand years before the expedition of xerxes against greece this interpretation is favored by diogenes laertius who makes reference to xanthus but although a few scholars a s shabazi helmut humbach have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts it is generally rejected although the historical value of the greek sources is negligible they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in iran by the achaemenid period as the above account would seem to demonstrate they also show that by this time zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure one from an extremely distant past all of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with or even close to that of the achaemenids later zoroastrian sources the pahlavi texts do provide an absolute chrono logy for zarathushtra one that was also accepted by some arab authors accord ing to these sources zarathushtra lived or years before alexander again scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification the most convincing arguments however seem to support the latter position the figure of years is accurate only on the surface because it represents in fact the more general one of which was employed by sasanid propagandists to locate zarathushtra s lifetime roughly around the beginning of iranian domination for a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the iranian chronology there was also a desire on the part of the sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat in this context zarathushtra whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos converted vishtaspa at the age of forty two and vishtaspa s conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium thus explaining the double date of and years before alexander given the unreliability of the few available sources we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements principally on the contention that zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before cyrus the great cambyses and darius as there is no mention in the avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western iran in the middle of the first millennium bce nor is there any mention of the history of that period which was to lead iran to a position of such predominance at the same time for a number of reasons going back much further in history would not be justified consequently the traditionally accepted theory of placing zara thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium bce appears to be the most legitimate as to zarathushtra s land of origin many scholars agree on the basis of valid arguments that he must have come from eastern iran some have held that he was a mede largely because of a late iranian tradition linking zarathushtra with azerbaijan but also because of linguistic reasons based on the language of the avesta this hypothesis however should be discarded as we can suppose both on historical and linguistic grounds that zarathushtra came from the east even though we do not know precisely from which region there is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter including the improbable view that he came from chorasmia or present day khorezm or from a wider chorasmian region reaching as far as the oases of merv and herat most likely however zarathushtra s land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the hindu kush mountain range to the more southern regions of bactria and arachosia modern qandahar as well as drangiana the area of lake helmand it would thus be located in what is now afghanistan or in the border regions of iran zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste yasna he was a zaotar cf sanskrit hotr that is a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry even in the so called younger avesta he is described as an athravan yashts a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste to enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training which he used to lend dignity as in the gathas to the contents of his new message the product of a great and original ethical mind zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition linking india to iran in another way by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan or possessor of asha that is the one who as in the vedic rtavan seeks truth and masters it thus becoming ashavan in this life almost an initiate and blessed after death any good follower of such teachings seeks the vision of asha just as those chosing the right path in vedic india aspired to the vision of the sun a manifestation of rta behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of aryan mysticism that is of indo iranian mysticism zarathushtra s greatness however does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition rather it lies in the innovation and strength of his message which was in itself a break in the tradition one that force fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas dualistic monotheism the wise lord who fathers two twin spirits the beneficent and the evil and the expectation of a transfiguration av frashokereti pahl frashgird of life and existence see frashokereti both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate zarathushtra s teachings from the indo iranian tradi tions of his upbringing they exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil because of his basic tenets zarathushtra who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi tion can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures another original facet of zarathushtra s message one that is not easy to understand but which however holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the gathas is the doctrine of the amesha spentas the beneficent immortals these are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought best truth desirable power bounteous devotion wholeness and immortality all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue see amesha spentas other than the names of his father pourushaspa possessing gray horses and of his mother dughdova one who has milked we know almost nothing of zarathushtra s life a late pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers according to tradition zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty and at thirty he was subject to a revelation both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision only after ten years had passed however did he succeed in converting a cousin of his maidhyoimah to his beliefs he was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis karapans and usijs priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices this hostility caused him to leave his region yasna and to seek refuge at the court of kavi vishtaspa a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife hutaosa when the prophet according to tradition was forty two years old we also know the name of a son isat vastra desiring pastures and of three daughters born of his first wife as well as the names of two more sons urvatatnara commanding men and hvarecithra sun faced born of his second wife hvovi a member of the influential hvogva possessing good cattle family two other figures belonging to the hvogva family are mentioned frashaoshtra and jamaspa the former as hvovi s father and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet pouruchista very thoughtful whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the gathas yasna again according to tradition zarathushtra died at the age of seventy seven he was assassinated by a karapan a priest of the old religion who belonged to the tuirya tribe and was called tur i bradres his name is known only in the pahlavi form the paucity of information on the prophet s life is compensated by a tradi tion rich in legendary detail that arose through the centuries in zoroastrian communities the main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the denkard a pahlavi work dating from the ninth century ce as well as passages from other pahlavi texts and a new persian work from the thirteenth century the zarathusht nama book of zarathushtra written by zaratusht i bahram i pazhdu mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about zarathushtra which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man zarathushtra s great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the renaissance until the enlightenment during the classical and hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man a typical representative of an alien wisdom a master of the secrets of heaven and earth a seer astrologer psychologist and wonder worker pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of zarathushtra on pythagoras himself and the academicians always openly admired the persian thinker who founded the school of the magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism earliest christianity viewed zarathushtra as a precursor of the christian faith one who not only prophesied as had the biblical prophets the advent of the messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming the star that was to appear in the east and guide the three magi to the manger in bethlehem see magi this christian interpretation is derived from the zoroastrian doctrine of the saoshyant the savior of the future see saoshyant later however religious struggles arose during the sasanid empire in persia third to seventh centuries ce which linked the spread of christianity with the roman empire zarathushtra s popularity in the christian world began to decline the iranian prophet who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by mani as one of the three great messengers from the past was now seen instead as a leader of imposture and heresy a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery but during the renaiss ance and the enlightenment european cultures reverted to the image of zara thushtra that had come down through classical and hellenistic antiquity he was viewed once again as a great and wise man as the author of the chaldean oracles and probably inventor of qabbalah as a teacher of astrology as a possible bridge between christianity and platonism and at times as in voltaire as a symbol of non christian wisdom after western philology rediscovered zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries friedrich nietzsche in an intentional paradox gave the name zarathustra to the hero of his work also sprach zarathustra nietzsche saw the iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things that is the eternal struggle between good and evil see also zoroastrianism,talk.religion.misc

the name of the guy responsible for much of the uniforms and props used by the early nazis in their rallies and such the name is roehm not rhoemer and hitler does claim that he came up with the swastika business but didn t he credit the actual flag design to a party member some dentist or other i believe he gives such credit in mein kampf he was killed in an early nazi purge he and many of his associates were flaming homosexuals well know also for their flamboyant orgies i have been trying to find if there is any actual evidence for this common assertion recently postings to such groups as soc history and soc culture german has not uncovered any net experts who could provide any well i m no expert but all of the histories of nazi germany assert this they make reference to several scandals that occurred long before the night of the long knives the impression that i got was that homosexuality in portions of the sa was common knowledge also a book by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment called homosexuals in history asserts that roehm and heines were homosexuals as well as others in roehm s sa circle all the books say that roehm and his associate edmund heines were homosexual i have been able to find nothing beyond that and suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend well you re the one who is in germany if you don t believe the history books look up the primary sources yourself those of us outside of germany do not have access to these you do it seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances several scandals the fact that on the knight of the long knives several sa members including heines were found sleeping together etc also i believe some people were complaining about the sa s homosexual activities seducing young boys etc the histories that i ve read make a very convincing case none of this sounds like urban legend to me irving a notoriously unreliable historian says that funk the nazi finance minister was homosexual he gives no sources i know next to nothing about irving and nothing about funk what precisely do you know that would contradict all of the other history books that i have read concerning the existence of homosexual nazis are you trying to say that all historians are taking part in an anti homosexual smear what about homosexual writers who agree with the official history don t you think they would have found out the truth by now if roehm and heines were not homosexuals i would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from nazism no one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case i challenge anyone to document this claim if you are going to challenge all historians on this point not just irving then the burden of proof is on you track down the references find out where the stories originate from again you are the one in germany close to archival material most people on the net are not i have found a great deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the nazis this seems to include all of the worst ones hitler himmler goebbels goering heydrich eichmann and many more eh what is your agenda here to prove that the nazis were heterosexuals so that you can bash heterosexuals does it bother you that some of the nazis might have been homosexuals does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true of course not and what about bisexuals are they half nazis i don t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some nazis were homosexuals the german officer corps before ww for instance was notorious for its homosexuality there were numerous scandals which rocked the german govt during the late th and early th century many of the kaiser s friends were prosecuted the kaiser was no homosexual but the germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality going far back into prussian history back to frederick the great at least who was himself a homosexual roehm was a product of this prussian officer tradition and the old german army like the english public school system being a well known center of homosexuality would have been quite willing to overlook roehm s homosexuality in addition some nazis complained of homosexuality in the hitler youth the hitler youth swallowed up all pre nazi youth groups and some of the various pre war vandervogel bund and volkish youth groups were known to promote homoerotic ideals and friendship and in many cases homosexuality itself so it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual nazis regardless of the official nazi dogmas concerning the evils of homosexuality why should this suprise anyone homosexuality has always existed in all societies it would be most unusual if the nazis were an exception no i don t have any sources for you as i think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material and i do not have access to these nor do i intend to reread every book on the nazis and on modern homosexuality that i have ever read i don t have the time nothing is stopping you however from chasing down those sources until you prove otherwise though i will

from ddavis cass ma bull com dave davis newsgroups talk religion misc subject re christian meta ethics date apr organization bull world wide information systems inc lines distribution na message id r c c cass ma bull com nntp posting host cass ma bull com russell turpin as is his wont has raised some interesting issues in his struggle with the christian texts and the christians unfortunately he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is not available the lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such as humanity also unfortunately perhaps i have a deadline in two weeks the responsibility for which prevents me in good conscience from writing a more considered response and fully entering the fray as it were let me then say what i can briefly the two commandments are rules they are merely rules that are so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning this point for the net browsers who also still read books is pursued throughly in kaufmann critique of religion and philosophy the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed in part as reminding man that he is not god and cannot act as if he has ultimate responsibility this is a theological statement worthy of barth dr turpin dd may wear the black robe of geneva yet indeed many traditions present an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret loving one s neighbor as following various other rules and relying on their god to make things come out right precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate responsibility once again we are confronted with good sounding goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean this requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among them i wouldn t make that assumption i don t think it is a reasonable assumption and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted there are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward reading show the christian god behaving in just this way michael and i and others read the bible with christian glasses among the things that this should imply is that the nt informs the ot even to the point of dominanting it some points in the ot ceremonial dietary laws are explicitly abrogated by the nt texts to drive russell turpin s point with adequacy one needs to begin with nt texts probably from matthew and probably about damnation just trying to help this part is i discover what most moves me to post mls i am a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously no michael the conservative christians also take the gospel seriously what differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel russell turpin s no here is misplaced not to say inappropriate michael s self description much govern the equation of radical liberal which seems implied by russell turpin is wrong radical conservatives are possible if sadly lacking in numbers at present thomas merton was a radical even though conservative in some ways st francis was a radical similarly how many examples are needed mls why don t i and the myriads of other christians like me mls tell you something about christianity michael s question gets to a heart of the matter klingons have two hearts so my metaphor is not mixed just extraterrestrial russell turpin in an earlier post had said that michael michael s theological positions actually didn t tell him much about christianity dean simeon responds this time gently what do you mean more direct perhaps would have been what could you possibly mean the implied rhetorical effort to separate michael from the tradition is a failure michael is in the tradition if your idea of the tradition doesn t include him change your idea of the tradition the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity per se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and gays how can one answer this while staying on the more general issue i m on the other side of the interpretive fence from michael on this issue yet nothing is a hideous overstatement one verse is enough to refute it i ll offer two from paul of all people in jesus christ there is neither male nor female galatians i don t quote single verses as a rule and i don t carry them in my head and nothing shall separate us from the glory of god roughly from romans if russell would promise to convert based on these or any other verses i d promise to get the full context for any that he requires in short it is the extra christian principles that make michael s christianity beneficial and i suspect they would be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by christian interpretation this conclusion does not follow even in short from the argument that goes before a surprising logical ellipsis dave davis ddavis ma bull com these are my opinions activities alone qotd wild beasts trapped in their cages are not so fierce

date thu apr gmt lines let me begin by saying i think this is the world s first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium therefore even if this religion does not take off its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become common the basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional morality to the characters in genesis and exodus but assume that the bible s accounts of the facts and historical events is correct for example story of adam and eve adam and eve are in garden of eden naked and ignorant have unlimited supply of food provided but no clothing jobs or knowledge god says not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge they do anyway then try to hide in bushes god finds them and forces them out of garden there are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in the bushes that might have angered god traditional philosophy the only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat if someone else will provide you with food then you can be stupid and unemployed and it s ok this is why married women usually didn t work until recent decades authority figures such as god whoever was behind the vietnam war hitler and slaveowners are always right and should be blindly followed without question by ordinary people who can t make decisions for themselves interpretation of events based on traditional philosophy they were not supposed to eat the fruit they should have done whatever god told them to like small children they had their needs provided for and were obligated to do whatever their father said to being forced to leave the garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment lessons from traditional interpretation ignorance is good knowledge is bad but tempting having food provided for you for nothing read welfare is ideal get ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment public nudity is good covering up is bad authority figures are intrinsically right normal people are dumb and should do whatever they are told without question they should not think for themselves people in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from learning for example it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read s philosophy people should seek education and employment outside the home unless named hillary clinton or murphy brown people should use common sense they should not kill other people binding of issac wars holocaust etc just because they are told to interpretation of events based on current philosophy they were supposed to eat the fruit god gave wanted them to seek knowledge rather than be handed it on a silver platter once they had gained knowledge and by seeking it showed their ability to make mature decisions for them selves they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were rewarded by being allowed into the real world lessons from new interpretation ignorance is bad knowledge is good but must be sought having food provided for you for nothing read welfare is at best a temporary measure getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is ideal public nudity is bad covering up is good authority figures are often wrong normal people are intelligent and should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and alter or abolish bad governments they should think for themselves people in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge but should seek it anyway and all the harder for example poor children without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better life for their children and themselves i have tentatively named this new philosophy the church of eveism because eve s decision to eat the apple is man sic kind s first good decision instead of its first bad one as traditionally believed she is therefore clearly a protagonist god at first appears evil for telling people not to seek knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist as god rewarded the decision to defy him and provided the tree in the first place the intention and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained but to delay it until it was actively sought end serious discussion begin humor save this post to disk or file server someday it will be considered the most important writing

is bad it s a reasonable conclusion that the sun really does exist and that the deal really is bad i disagree completely until rather recently most people did not believe in evolution or the possibility of the atom bomb popular opinion is notoriously wrong about matters of fact true but nevertheless the basis of all matters of fact is overwhelming popular opinion and some overwhelming popular opinion is fact the sun shines if it were not so physics would be a personal matter assumed to be different for each of us there would be yourgravity and mygravity and no theoretical framework to encompass them and predict both this is simply complete nonsense the basis for matters of fact is if any class of opinion the majority of informed popular opinion for some value of informed i would really hate to base my knowledge of for instance qm on what the overwhelming popular opinion is the basis eric is people peering at the world and saying what they see i m talking about uninterpreted facts observations people do those agreement on some observations is a prerequisite for a theory that is more than personal yes that s true but you have to be clear exactly what is an uninterpreted observation it s pretty low level stuff the sun shines is already a lot higher level than that we can agree that i perceive brightness perhaps now i take an experience of good evil to be every bit as raw a fact as an experience of pain or vision that might seem like a good first pass guess but it turns out to be a pretty cruddy way to look at things because we all seem to have rather different opinions experiences about what is good and evil while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says you re not comparing apples with apples if we all look at the same meter we ll agree if we re all in the same situation that s when we ll agree on fundamental values if at all people who say that nobody agrees on values to the same extent that they agree on trivial observations seem to be unaware of the extent of agreement on either huh what do you mean all in the same situation let s take me and dennis kriz as examples we re in pretty different situations but i think we can agree as to whether it s day or night i don t think we can agree as to whether or not abortion is morally acceptable yet we are certainly in the same difference of situations with respect to each other looks like weasel words to me frank i don t see that it s any evidence at all as i point out above i m really not interested very much in what the popular opinion is i m prepared to trust to some extent the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation because by and large they accord with my own however if everyone else said the dial read and it looked like a to me i would hope that i would believe myself i e believing other people about these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting what i would believe if i observed myself but the possibility exists that it is not since i know from observation that others disagree with me about what is good i believe i can discount popular opinion about good from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion i would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus actually firstly if everyone else said the dial was and i saw i d check my lens prescription that s up to you i guess secondly your observation that people disagree shows nothing people may be looking at different things by virtue of being in different situations if i look at an elephant i ll see an elephant that doesn t imply that you will see an elephant if you look at an iguana this different situations stuff is pretty confusing frank how do we decide if we are in the same situation you mind explaining thirdly i question your assumption that when people disagree about how to achieve fundamental or

from mcelwre cnsvax uwec edu newsgroups talk religion misc subject larsonian astronomy physics creation message id apr cnsvax uwec edu date apr organization university of wisconsin eau claire lines the following partial summary of a theory of the universe includes a little known description of the creation of our solar system larsonian astronomy and physics orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists claim to be looking for a unified field theory in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations but they have been systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for years the late physicist dewey b larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he calls the reciprocal system is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and in two reciprocal forms space and time the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean from these two postulates larson developed a complete theoretical universe using various combinations of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational rotational motions the concepts of in ward and out ward scalar motions and speeds in relation to the speed of light which larson called unit velocity and the natural datum at each step in the development larson was able to match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the real physical universe photons sub atomic particles incomplete atoms charges atoms molecules globular star clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white dwarf stars pulsars quasars etc even objects not yet discovered then such as exploding galaxies and gamma ray bursts and applying his theory to his new model of the atom larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter atomic distances in crystals and molecules compressibility and thermal expansion of solids and other properties of matter all of this is described in good detail with out fancy complex mathematics in his books books of dewey b larson the following is a complete list of the late physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe some of the early books are out of print now but still available through inter library loan the structure of the physical universe the case against the nuclear atom beyond newton new light on space and time quasars and pulsars nothing but motion a substitute for the billion super collider the last four chapters explain chemical bonding the neglected facts of science the universe of motion final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries basic properties of matter all but the last of these books were published by north pacific publishers p o box portland or and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library doesn t have each of them several of them including the last one are available from the international society of unified science isus e atkin ave salt lake city utah this is the organization that was started to promote larson s theory they have other related publications including the quarterly journal reciprocity physicist dewey b larson s background physicist dewey b larson was a retired engineer chemical or electrical he was about years old when he died in may he had a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute chemical properties based only on the elements used larson s lack of a fancy ph d degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is not a valid reason sometimes it takes a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the trees at the same time it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradictions ad hoc assumptions principles of impotence in consistencies etc larson did not have the funds etc to experimentally test his theory and it was not necessary for him to do so he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational data and in many cases his explanation fit better a self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox physicists and astronomers have they claim to be looking for a unified field theory that works but have been ignoring one for over years now modern physics does not explain the physical universe so well some parts of some of larson s books are full of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree and remember that epicycles crystal spheres geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed to explain it well but were later proved conceptually wrong prof frank h meyer professor emeritus of uw superior was is a strong proponent of larson s theory and was or still is president of larson s organization the international society of unified science and editor of their quarterly journal reciprocity he moved to minneapolis after retiring super collider boondoggle i am against contruction of the superconducting super collider in texas or anywhere else it would be a gross waste of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value most physicists don t realize it but according to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b larson as described in his books the strange goofy particles mesons hyperons alleged quarks etc which they are finding in existing colliders fermi lab cern etc are really just atoms of anti matter which are created by the high energy colliding beams and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment a larger and more expensive collider will only create a few more elements of anti matter that the physicists have not seen there before and the physicists will be even more confused than they are now are a few more types of anti matter atoms worth the billion cost don t we have much more important uses for this wasted money another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground cables how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the supercollider naming the super collider after ronald reagon as proposed is totally absurd if it is built it should be named after a leading particle physicist larsonian anti matter in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti matter is not a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles it has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum in larson s theory a positron is actually a particle of matter not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their respective photons of which they are made neutralize each other in larson s theory the anti matter half of the physical universe has three dimensions of time and only one dimension of space and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the rate of seconds of arc per century seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets venus earth jupiter etc the remaining seconds of arc are being used to help prove einstein s general theory of relativity but the late physicist dewey b larson achieved results closer to the seconds than general relativity can by instead using special relativity in one or more of his books he applied the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally rejected general relativity as another mathematical fantasy he also rejected most of special relativity including the parts about mass increases near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts those quasars with red shifts greater than really are moving faster than the speed of light although most of that motion is away from us in time in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there are three dimensions of time instead of only one but two of those dimensions can not be measured from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure is the clock time at low relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are negligible but at high speeds they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor larson often used the term coordinate time when writing about this in regard to mass increases it has been proven in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration is acceleration force mass a f m orthodox physicists are ignoring the third factor force in larson s theory mass stays constant and force drops toward zero force is actually a motion or combinations of motions or relations between motions including inward and outward scalar motions the expansion of the universe for example is an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so called big bang which is yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion by dewey b larson north pacific publishers p o box portland oregon pages indexed hardcover it contains the astrophysical portions of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author an unrecognized genius more than thirty years ago it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries including the formation of galaxies binary and multiple star systems and solar systems the true origin of the degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts and the true nature of quasars pulsars white dwarfs exploding galaxies etc it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with open minds the following is an example of his theory s success in his first book in the structure of the physical universe larson predicted the existence of exploding galaxies several years before astronomers started finding them they are a necessary consequence of larson s comprehensive theory and when quasars were discovered he had an immediate related explanation for them also gamma ray bursts astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts they were originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the disc of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly and their source locations in space do not correspond to any known objects except for a few cases of directional coincidence gamma ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson according to page of his book the universe of motion published in the gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material halves of the physical universe and the way they are connected together the gamma ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this is why the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects and come from all directions uniformly i wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were actually caused by nearby gamma ray bursts larsonian binary star formation about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double but orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them but binary star systems are actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson i will try to summarize larsons explanation which is detailed in chapter of his book the universe of motion and in some of his other books first of all according to larson stars do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse the rest results from the complete annihilation of heavy elements heavier than iron each element has a destructive temperature limit the heavier the element is the lower is this limit a star s internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements when the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of iron there is a type i supernova explosion this is because there is so much iron present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process which larson explains in some of his books better than i can when the star explodes the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion pushes that material over the speed of light and it expands outward in time which is equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappears for a while over long periods of time both masses start to fall back gravitationally the material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a red giant star the material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a white dwarf star both stars then start moving back toward the main sequence from opposite directions on the h r diagram the chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space making a single lone star again are near zero they will instead form a binary system orbiting each other according to larson a white dwarf star has an inverse density gradient is densest at its surface because the material at its center is most widely dispersed blown outward in time this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter neutron stars black holes etc larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf stars revolving around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected by its heat etc these will become planets in chapter of the universe of motion larson used all this information and other principles of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode s law black hole fantasy i heard that physicist stephen w hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black holes merging together into a single black hole and concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than the sum of the two original black holes such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red flag causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black holes etc after reading physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially his book the universe of motion it is clear to me that black holes are nothing more than mathematical fantasies the strange object at cygnus x is just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to prove their theory by the way i do not understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist stephen hawking the physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking s severe physical problem somehow makes him wiser it does not i wish the same attention had been given to physicist dewey b larson while he was still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be given to larson s theory books and organization the international society of unified science electro magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many years ago in connection with ufo s and unorthodox inventors but i never was able to find out how or why they work or how they are constructed i found a possible clue about why they might work on pages of the book basic properties of matter by the late physicist dewey b larson which describes part of larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe i quote one paragraph as indicated in the preceding chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electrons we find are derived from the environment it was brought out in volume i larson s book nothing but motion that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities and that although the motions that constitute these electrons are in many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited it follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector material half of the universe most of which are uncharged in this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space because they are inherently rotating units of space and the relation of space to space is not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later whereby electrons are returned to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level note that in larson s theory uncharged electrons are also massless and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity is the speed of light and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light according to larson s theory i might have the above and below labels mixed up larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass less un charged electrons flying around at the speed of light if this is true then the electro magnetic propulsion fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons or other particles in space perhaps giving them a charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion in larson s theory an electrical charge is a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds suppression of larsonian physics the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson has been available for more than years published in in his first book the structure of the physical universe it is totally un scientific for hawking wheeler sagan and the other sacred priests of the religion they call science or physics or astronomy etc as well as the scientific literature and the education systems to totally ignore larson s theory has they have larson s theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such as gamma ray bursts and the nature of quasars larson s theory deserves to be honestly and openly discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals in the u s and elsewhere and at least the basic principles of larson s theory should be included in all related courses at

addressed nor commented on in any way i made no comment on who is right or who is wrong only that civilians are being used as cover and that having been placed in between the israelis and the guerillas they will be injured as both parties continue their fight pardon me tim but i do not see how it can be possible for the idf to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which killed the three idf troops and then later know the exact number and whereabouts of all of them several villages were shelled how could the idf possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted villages you see it was an arbitrary act of retaliation i will again repeat my statement i do not condone these indiscriminate israeli acts nor have i ever if the villagers do not know who these guerillas are which you stated earlier how do you expect the israelis to know it is very difficult to identify who they are this is why the guerillas prefer to lose themselves in the general population by dressing the same acting the same etc the host arab state did little nothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with israel the problem tim is that the original reason for the invasion was palestinian attacks on israel not lebanese attacks i agree but because lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these attacks from its territory should israel simply sit quietly and accept its situation israel asked the lebanese government over and over to control this third party state within lebanese territory and the attacks kept occuring at what point does israel or any state have the right to do something itself to stop such attacks never while the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars have been removed the weapons needed to cross border attacks still remain to some extent rocket attacks still continue and commando raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life yours of that of others such attacks also continue yes i am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify occupying your neighbor s land israel must resolve its disputes with the native palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks it is also the responsibility of any state to not allow any outside party to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state if angola had the power and south africa refused or couldn t stop anti angolan guerillas based on sa soil from attacking angola and south africa refused to have un troops stationed on its territory between it and angola would angola be justified in entering sa if not are you saying that angola had to accept the situation do nothing and absorb the attacks bat guano the situation you call for existed in the s and attacks were commonplace not true lebanese were not attacking israel in the s with a strong lebanese government free from syrian and israeli interference i believe that the border could be adequately patrolled the palestinian heavy weapons have been siezed in past years and i do not see as significant a threat as once existed i refered above at all times to the palestinian attacks on israel from lebanese soil not to lebanese attacks on israel one hopes that a lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its border but there is no reason to believe it will be any stronger what has changed is that the plo was largely driven out of lebanon not by the lebanese not by syria and that is by far the most important making it easier to control future palestinian attacks from lebanese soil that change was brought about by israeli action the plo would never have been ejected by lebanese arab state or un actions please tim don t fall into the trap of treating lebanese and palestinians as all part of the same group there are too many who think all arabs or all muslims are the same too many times i have seen people support the bombing of palestinian camps in retaliation for an idf death at the hands of the lebanese resistance or the shelling of lebanese villages in retaliation for a palestinian attack i fully recognize that the lebanese do not want to be used by either side and have been and continue to be but the most fundamental issue is that if a state cannot control its borders and make real efforts to do so it should expect others to do it for them hopefully that other will be the un but it is as we see in its cowardice regarding bosnia weak tim,talk.politics.mideast

painful search the gruesome extent of february s killings of azeris by armenians in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan about men women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four year war over nagorny karabakh the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates the february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four year campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief stricken azerbaijan s wild and contradictory allegations of up to dead the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of a man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali disaster said his figure of people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov the mayor of hojali an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may dead people named and more than bodies reported unidentified this figure of nearly dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of the international red cross in baku said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of bodies received at his mosque from hojali most of them civilians we did not count the bodies but the figure seems reasonable it is no fantasy mr zen ruffinen said we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre don t get worked up it will take several months to get a final figure the year old lawyer said at his small office mr rasulov knows about these things it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that people were killed and wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january those nationalists the popular front finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali an azeri town which lies about miles from the border with armenia fell to the armenians officially people have so far been certified as dead being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic s forensic department this is just a small percentage of the dead said rafiq youssifov the republic s chief forensic scientist they were the only bodies brought to us remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within hours of these people were women and were children under years old gunshots killed people shrapnel killed and axes or blunt instruments killed exposure in the highland snows killed the last three thirty three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out according to professor youssifov s report those bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed mr rasulov said files from mr rasulov s investigative commission are still disorganised lists of azeri militiamen are dead here six policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the names of corpses brought to be washed in just one day the most heartbreaking account from witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on february there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly in hojali people by the stream and the road and visible around nakhchivanik village mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot people waved up to us for help we saw three dead children and one two year old alive by one dead woman the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces the independent london heroes who fought on amid the bodies aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe bar on the caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of hojali just over three months ago writes hugh pope i m still wearing the same clothes i don t have any others the year old carpenter said beginning his account of the hojali disaster i was wounded in five places but i am lucky to be alive mr sadikov and his wife were short of food without electricity for more than a month and cut off from helicopter flights for days they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the to people left in the straggling azeri town on the edge of karabakh at about pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before eight or nine kinds of weapons artillery heavy machine guns the lot mr sadikov said soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town down a hill through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side to escape the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam about miles away they thought they were going to make it until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak none of my group was hurt up to then then we were spotted by a car on the road and the armenian outposts started opening fire mr sadikov said azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians but their efforts were mostly in vain mr sadikov said only people from his group of made it through including his wife and militiaman son seven of his immediate relations died including his year old elder brother i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat he said pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes we have never got any of the bodies back the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire one hero of the evacuation alif hajief was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group s crossing mr sadikov said another hero elman memmedov the mayor of hojali said he and several others spent the whole day of february in the bushy hillside surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee the night after we reached the town there was a big armenian rocket attack some people just kept going mr sadikov said i had to get to the hospital for treatment i was in a bad way they even found a bullet in my sock victims of

noticed about to people standing near the podium at the city party committee but they were silent there s no conversation whatsoever and we couldn t figure out what was going on that is we knew it was about karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if someone gave a speech or not we didn t know we bought our tickets there were or people in the theater this was a very small number for that large movie theater the film started about minutes later they stopped the film a crowd burst in about people they came up onto the stage well mostly they were young people from to years old they demanded that an armenian woman come up onto the stage they used foul language and said that they were going to show what azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do to armenian girls i thought that s what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically marina and i were sitting together i told her to move over there were some russian girls sitting nearby so that if someone recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not marina it got quiet or girls jumped up to run out but the door was closed it s only opened at the end of the show and they returned to their seats everyone in the theater was looking at one another russians azerbaijanis people of various nationalities but no one reacted at all no one in the auditorium made a sound they were silent looking at one another and gradually started to leave some guy a really fat one says ok we ve scared them enough let s leave they leave slowly pompously it seemed to me that those people were not themselves either they had smoked a bunch of anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like they were ready to tear anyone apart then it was all over as though

they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors there are basically all glass everything was broken he stood there grief stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot well since he looked more or less calm i decided that nothing all that super serious had happened we went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we live literally one stop away we didn t want to go on foot not because it was dark but because something might happen we flagged down a cab but the driver didn t want to take us we told him we live near the bus station and he said he d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther i said well ok so we got into the cab and managed to get there something incredible was happening at the bus station there was a traffic jam public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ka ra bagh they re not going to give up karabagh i go home and tell my family what s going on and there s immediate panic in the house mamma says what should we do like the end had come they were going to come kill us that s it somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up nothing that bad could happen where are we living anyway just what kind of social order do we have somehow we manage to calm mamma down and we went to bed but no one could sleep everyone made as though nothing had happened that was on saturday in short the day went by we didn t go anywhere and didn t call our relatives no one did anything because life goes on that day i realized something was approaching but what exactly i couldn t guess on the th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always had there were five of us at home mamma papa and us three sisters lyuda marina and i my sister lyuda was in yerevan at the time we sat at home and no one went out later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning it all started they were smashing up stores we were sitting at home and didn t know anything about it then a girlfriend of mine lyuda zimogliad came by at around three o clock i think we worked together we did our apprenticeships together she s a russian girl she said that something awful was happening in town i asked don t they want armenians well what are they after if they re already in that state she says no nothing like that it s just a demonstration but it s awful to watch it somehow it feels like a war has broken out public transportation has been stopped the cabs the buses well it s just a nightmare then papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy problems at the time he left the house and our neighbor aunt vera asked him where are you going stop there are such terrible things going on in the courtyard aren t you afraid to go out papa didn t know what she was talking about she simply pushed him back into the entryway he came home and told mamma mamma said well if aunt vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on but we didn t go see her she s a russian she lives across from us i had to see my friend out around five o clock i tell lyuda ok look it s time for you to go it s late already i ll see you out mamma says you don t need to go it s too late already you can see what the situation in town is so we decided to stay home dinner was ready mamma says let her eat with us then she can go we sat down at the table but no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we re eating we turned on the television and the show in fairy tale land was coming on we cleared the table we hear some noise out in the courtyard i go out on the balcony but i can t see what s going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station and there is a story building in the way there is mob of people i can t figure out what s happening they re shouting something looking somewhere i can t make out what is going on i go down to a neighbor she s an azerbaijani we ve been friends of her family for about years i go down to look from their place i see people shouting looking at the and story buildings near the bus station just then soldiers set upon them about people with clubs the mob runs off in different directions i even see several people from our building they are looking and laughing i decide that means it s not all that bad if they are laughing it means they re not killing anyone but now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers one of the soldiers cannot manage to get away they start stomping on him with their feet everyone s kicking him i become ill and go home and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there can t speak well they ve probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is if each of them kicked him just once they took his club away from him and started to beat him with it but it was far away and i couldn t see if he got up and left or not i become terrified and go home and say lyuda don t go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the story building and starts shouting something we go out onto the balcony all of our neighbors are also out on theirs too everyone is standing staring the mob is shouting and about minutes later comes running toward our building as it turns out at the story building the azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in there s only one entryway there they could stop them they all run up to our building mamma immediately starts closing the windows afraid that they might throw stones they have stones and they break the windows all of them there are very many people we have a large courtyard and it s packed with people they spill up to the first floor so they don t crush each other they crawl up on trees posts and garages it s just a huge cloud of people they break and burn the motorcycle of the armenian sergey sargisian from our building we close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway they come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar it s incomprehensible mamma told me later that they were shouting father s name grisha open the door we ve come to kill you or something like that i don t remember that i was spaced out kind of mamma says into the bedroom quickly in the bedroom we have two tall beds part of our dowry mamma says hide there they probably won t come in there they ll ask something say something and leave she says we ll tell them that we live alone here i can t imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts i go to them and say that i ll stand together with them i ll talk with them if they come maybe i can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me i speak azerbaijani more or less and i can find out what they want i told marina and lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister lyuda i can t remember if i told her anything or not then they open the door it s like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall the crows bursts in and starts to shout get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your armenia things like that i tell them what has happened speak calmly one of you tell me calmly what has happened in azerbaijani they say get out of the apartment leave i say ok go downstairs we ll gather everything we need and leave the apartment i realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them these are animals they must be stopped the ones standing in the doorway the young guys say there are old people and one girl with them too bad they take two or three steps back it seems as though i have pacified them with our exchange then someone in the courtyard shouts commanding them don t you understand what you are saying kill them and that was it that was all it took they grab papa carry him into one room and mamma and me into another they put mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs they start tearing my clothes right there in front of mamma i don t remember where they went what they did or how much time passed i had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time i don t even know what i said the atrocities started i was savagely raped in that room they argued among themselves who would go first later i remember i came to i don t know if i m dead or alive someone comes in someone tall i think clean shaven in an eskimo dogskin coat balding he looks around at what s happening at that instant everything stops it seems to me that he is either their commander or that somehow everything depends on him he looks and says well we re done here they are beating mamma on the head they break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs she loses consciousness and they decide that she s dead papa was out cold they want to throw lyuda off the balcony but they can t get the window open apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can t be opened they leave her next to the window she was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out she s not a real strong person anyway he looks at me and sees that i m saying something that i m still twitching well i start saying the opposite of what i should be which is humbling myself and pleading i start shouting cursing they don t get any entreaty out of me i already know that i m dead why would i humble myself before anyone and he says that if that s what i think since my tongue is so long maybe he thinks that i still look quite appealing in short he commands that i be taken outside i no longer saw or remembered what was happening to marina and lyuda i don t know if they are alive or not they take me outside they are dragging me by my arms by my legs they are hitting me against the wall the railings something metal while they are carrying me someone is biting me someone else is pinching me i don t even know i think my god when will death come if only it were sooner then they carry me out throw me near the entryway and start kicking me i lose consciousness what happened after that how many people there were i don t remember i come to after a while i don t remember how long a neighbor is bringing me clothing i m entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on me i remember that i said the same words over and over again mamma what happened mamma what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at i can t make sense out of anything there is a guy standing over me i sort of know him he served in afghanistan his name is igor he brought me indoors when they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there igor gathered his courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors even though he s small minded he put himself at risk igor agayev is azerbaijani he served in afghanistan there are three brothers the older brother also served there i think now he s stationed here on the border in armenia igor brought me to the neighbors and then helped me come to my senses saying karina i know you calm down i m not one of them how do i know who s who and what s what i come to and they clean me up i was covered in blood then papa i saw papa i saw mamma and marina too igor was there when they dragged marina and lyuda out from under the bed marina lyuda said that she was russian they said we ll let you go we aren t touching the russians go and while they are dragging marina out she decides she s going to tell them she s azerbaijani igor immediately grabs marina s and lyuda s hands because he knows marina and knows that she is armenian and is our sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor s and starts pounding on the door so she will open up she opens the door and igor pushes them in there so they survived my sister lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things while they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back up again lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor s on the fourth floor the one whose apartment i had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and knocked on the door the neighbor opened and said i m not going to let you in the apartment because i m afraid of them but i ll give you some stockings and we ll leave the building lyuda says i ll stay at your place because of what s going on they keep going up and down the stairs it was just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor wouldn t consent lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed i came to mother was there i can t remember my supervisor s telephone number but something had to be done somehow i remembered and called and he came to get us he didn t have any idea what was going on he thought we were simply afraid he didn t know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death he came and got us and took us to the police precinct there they looked us over i was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly it was hard to breathe my supervisor s name is urshan feyruzovich mamedov he s the head of our administration they took us there when we were leaving i saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town the buses were ordinary passenger buses there were very many soldiers we left around eleven right after eleven if these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives because the crowd was moving on toward the school and what was going on there i think everyone know not only in sumgait not only in yerevan because there they murdered them all one after the next without stopping after us i think people died in microdistrict no and to of them were from buildings and in our building one person died and one old woman died from building that s the building in front of ours there young azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn t let it into their building incidentally when we were at the neighbors marina called our relatives to warn them so they would all know what was happening i called a aunt in microdistrict no they have three neighbors who are armenians i said run quickly i can t explain what s going on hide do what you can just stay alive hide at azerbaijanis ones who won t give you away at that moment three people came in policemen i think they were azerbaijanis i was in such awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought i would ever see anything out of that eye again my forehead was badly cut and one half of my face was pushed out forward no one would have thought that i would survive get my normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all i started to scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you here haven t you killed people people yet what are you doing here one of the soldiers said don t scream at us we re muslims but we re not from the sumgait police they called in from daghestan so at that point the daghestan police were there when we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen i don t know maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct i don t know what they were there for there were also doctors from baku there they examined lyuda and me and said these women need to go to the maternity home but we don t know what to do with the rest so they took us and i lost contact with my parents my boss everyone my boss said don t worry i ll find you no matter where you are no matter what happens we went to the hospital there we were examined by a department head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva i think her name was she examined us the ambulance was from baku i figured out that the sumgait ambulances hadn t done anything they didn t respond to any calls people called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life that doctor looked me over and i could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened for she became quite glad i even thought to myself god can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong she looks me over and says now why are you suffering so you don t know what your people have been doing your people did even worse things and i think great i have to deal with her and i felt so bad i thought why don t i just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her here i am in this condition and being told about something that our people did i just didn t have the energy to say how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven t already done i stayed there then they brought in another woman ira b she was married and she was raped in her own apartment too there were three of us ira lyuda and the next morning they took lyuda and ira away they didn t do anything to help us this was in the old maternity home in the combined block they didn t do anything more than examine me that was it i didn t want any shots or tranquilizer nothing what shots could have calmed me down i didn t even want to look at them i lay in the ward either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur pose but i was alone i was alone even though the wards were packed that same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face was disfigured she asked what had happened to me and i said better to ask your brother what happened there s no point in asking me your brother can better explain what happened she fell into a faint all the doctors threw themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me clothing because i was literally naked the only thing i had on was a dress but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up above my knees and the woman orderly said i can t believe you put on such a short dress who are you showing off your legs to here i went back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something people from work came and brought me something in a sack apples i think three or four pounds but i couldn t take them i had become so weak that it was just embarrassing i said that i couldn t take the apples and really didn t have any appetite no one had to bring me anything some woman took the sack and oh yes then i heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that i was an armenian maybe they wouldn t figure it out from looking at me so they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen that it would be worse or perhaps someone was outside on the street i don t know in any case i didn t sleep a wink that night the next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus and off we went i didn t even know where they were taking me they took me to the club where the troops were the very one i was in that ill fated evening i got off the bus near the city party committee there were a great many troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was terrible i saw a few people i knew there and that calmed me a little i had already thought that i was the only one left so there were five or six of us left in sumgait after that night i still didn t know what happened to my parents they didn t come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was fine i didn t know whether to believe him or not maybe he was just trying to calm me down maybe something happened on the way then i went to the club and saw a lot of people i knew they all knew one another they were all kissing each other and asking what happened what went on two days later they came to see me from work they were there all the time each day they came showed interest and were constantly bringing me money they did everything they could of course i m most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues who didn t lose his presence of mind and who didn t change his opinions neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happened he constantly took an interest a sincere interest from the heart then about two days later the secretary of the party committee came not from our party organization but from the first trust which ours is part of comrade kerimov a very important figure in our town he made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if i sat down by myself i couldn t get up or lie down again there was something wrong with my lungs it was hard to breathe they examined me there several times there i lay were several doctors they all thought that that it must just be from all the blows i don t know they didn t diagnose anything in particular when i was in the maternity home i even asked i made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful there was no way something inside wasn t broken my ribs well they took me there and took x rays and said that everything was fine there were emergency medical workers on duty in the club the mother of one of marina s friends was there she was the head doctor at the sumgait children s clinic they had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what i needed at that moment i thought i said that i was having great difficulty breathing i couldn t seem to get enough air something was wrong with me they put tight bandages around my chest and waist later i overheard some people saying that i had been cut all over i think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut but i wasn t cut they took us to the khimik boarding house we lived there a long time soon appeared representatives they were agitating at first people would not talk to them and drove them off one of the armenian women shouted we demand that seidov come the response was it s seidov who sent us seidov is the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers the woman said we ll only see seidov s daughter have her come here we ll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters and then we ll deal with you agitators and so on more of them said have seidov himself come this went on day in day out the agitators kept coming and coming this drove us out of our wits then people gradually started departing for yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay everything got on our nerves the smell the small children there were children at the sk club children who had literally just come out of the maternity home what were they doing in a club that didn t even have running water all the time at first we had to pay to eat there they even overcharged us as it turned out on the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free the children were ill everything stank there well imagine about people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than you couldn t sit or lie down it was impossible to even move the stench was awful even the smallest infants took ill overnight there i heard that they were arriving seriously ill in yerevan the infants they have to be washed they have to be bathed not to mention that we the adults were ill and needed care people were fainting right and left i just don t know everyone was crying everyone only the young people the men somehow managed to keep it together but the women were in a constant state of panic it seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab it seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn t be a single armenian left then people went up to the attic i didn t see them i only heard them because i was lying down and couldn t get up i lay right on the stage we had some room there apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas i think they wanted to burn the theater maybe someone saw them i didn t i was in no condition to open my eyes everyone was suspicious of everyone else they would ask aren t you an azerbaijani i think i saw you somewhere i think you re an azerbaijani they led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports relatives might be covering for each other half of the people did not have any documents there were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like they should have with their ids so on the th on sunday i think the police did nothing to help us on monday everything resumed where it had left off on block a they didn t spare a soul there not children not pregnant women nobody they killed they burned they hacked with axes just everything possible they murdered the melkumian family whom i knew my mother worked with them their daughter in law went to school with my older sister they were brutally murdered only the two daughters in law survived by a miracle one was able to save herself she ran away the neighbors wouldn t take her in so she ran about the building until she found refuge she was pregnant and had two small children this all continued on monday in block a on the th when the troops were already in the city they murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire families they say they didn t even know for sure if the people were armenians or not i heard that the lezgins suffered too i m not sure myself i didn t see any lezgins who had been injured they burned cars so it s very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn t it was very difficult to identify the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned it s all very hard to imagine of course i heard that many people disappeared without a trace from the btz plant two people including a woman who worked the night shift aunt razmella who also lived in microdistrict they were stopping buses between baku and sumgait in the evening people who had been visiting baku were returning to sumgait and people from baku were going home from sumgait and there were students too they were simply savagely murdered they were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people they stopped the buses dragged the armenians out and killed them on the spot i didn t see it myself but i heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them later it was hard to discern from the corpses well you can t call them corpses you had to figure out from the ashes who it was l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student ira g if i m not mistaken she was in the hospital a long time after that and she still can t figure out who saved her she was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses the fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and carried her to the city i still can t imagine how he managed to do that i heard that from engels grigorian he knows her apparently well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway she was in the hospital and singing a song in armenian and they wrote the words down and i think he still has that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape they couldn t find the guy who saved her he left her in someone s apartment and called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me she couldn t remember anyone s face i think that i knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe i had talked with him once but i received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head i can t remember to this day who he was then it seems i saw the secretary of the directorate s party organization where marina works she goes to school and works she goes to night school at azi and works by day at the khimzashchita construction and installation administration i m the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of party and komsomol organizations we had joint meetings i know them all i ve even talked with them and he i know is from armenia an azerbaijani but from armenia it became obvious that many of those people were azerbaijanis born in armenia they took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the procuracy because the ussr procuracy got involved in the case and i iden tified the photographs of people who i could more or less recognize they showed me the people who were in our apartment they re working on our case but i can t even recognize them although it was proved that they were the ones they re processing it somehow they tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me there was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that all these people all of them as much as i ve heard about them and seen them they were all from kafan the secretary of the party organization is named najaf najaf rzayev he was there when everything started it must have been him because i didn t recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i knew besides him all the more since i told him listen you do something because you know me he turned away and went toward the bedroom where marina was well you couldn t see marina anyway there was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn t make out anyone all of it flew right out of my head and then gradually i became myself again at the city party committee there were military people there i told them what went on and they wrote it all down i told them his name on march the secretary of our first trust party organization the one we re part of came to see us his name is najaf rzayev i tell mamma if he s here despite the fact that i gave his name it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think i m crazy not responsible for my words he said what did they do to you how awful myself i hid an armenian family then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different i wasn t at home my family and i went to baku i said marina what is he saying he said something totally different before after that i didn t go to see our procurator our case is being handled by a procurator from voronezh fedorov by name fedorov told me that rzayev s case had just gotten to him and there were so names involved what are they doing with rzayev did he prove his alibi or not they just think that since i was hit in the head i can t say anything for sure whether it was him or not it will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn t have to pay for it but at the same time i m afraid to say i m a hundred percent sure that it was he because no mat ter who i name they tell me no you re wrong he didn t do that that one wasn t there all the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind who did what exactly i can t say when they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but i didn t see it because i had my eyes closed all the time it seemed to me that i always got it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible when they were beating my face i thought they were trying to put my eyes out so i had my eyes closed they took me outside and started to beat me a young guy held my arms he works at the btz plant and right nearby across the road from us block is where all this was going on right across the road from us the btz dormitory is over there that s where he lives now he s in custody they even have proved as far as i know that it was he who killed shurik gambarian the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building one person in our building was killed it was that man a guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me he saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he didn t come over he just looked and then went into the dormitory a while after it was all over people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned that guy went and told them everything now they ve caught him everything s been proved now evidently they ve been beating him i don t know what they re doing with them over there but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant some young guy came to the plant and said everyone who wants to kill armenians come to the bus station on saturday at ten that was it he said the ones who wanted to went this was at the btz plant during the night shift probably late friday night it was at night they were at the sauna together and he said what do you mean do you understand what you are saying the others were silent probably in their hearts they were thinking i m going to go but they didn t say anything to one another he said that he thought it important to to go because he had heard a lot about what had happened in kafan that they had killed their azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of that that guy was also born in kafan that is certain and marina says that the secretary of the party organization is from armenia too from i ve participated in the investigation a couple of times i m satisfied with them thus far they summoned us and asked about what happened and every word i said was recorded i met some guy there by the way he was an armenian i said that he was in our apartment but what he did i don t know his last name was grigorian eduard grigorian he s from sumgait from microdistrict he was sentenced i think to five years not his first time his mother is russian i met with him at the kgb in baku at the azerbaijani kgb they took us there and showed me photographs there were so many photographs i think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew and i ve got them all confused i say the face was about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasps but he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack well this guy grigorian i said he was in our apartment but he is so light complected that he looks like a lezgin i don t know what he did i can t remember maybe he beat me or raped me but he was in our apartment at the kgb he started asking me pleading with me there s no need for this all this stuff look me in the eyes you re like a sister to me i took a look at him and thought my god heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you but they were satisfied with my responses because i said everything without great certainty i was there with mamma then lyuda came in but when she came in she got sick immediately she wanted to kill him she crawled over the table at him she recognized him when she came to lyuda was lying on the balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom we had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three sisters they stole everything in the apartment leaving only small things at that moment lyuda came to and started remembering everything well seeing the faces hearing the voices two people were saying they could burn the apartment another says why burn the apartment when i ve got three kids and no place to live so this guy was in temporary housing he didn t have anywhere to live he was from sumgait they were sure that they would get the apartment besides the neighbors were azerbaijani why should they burn the apartment they might burn azerbaijanis that s what they said how did they know there were azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that armenians lived there we have a list of the residents for our part of the building our name is in there but how could they know that azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us so they didn t set fire to our apartment i don t know i was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when i was outside if someone had asked me what was happening i would have said that a civil war was going on well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they were beating me i opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at a free horror film so a civil war was going on and only the armenians were being fought if it were a world war or something like that they would have been fighting everyone but they only fought us then i met some women from our building some azerbaijanis they are crying they tell me karina we saw all of it how could it happen they re asking me well i just don t know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me i think that if it were the other way around either i wouldn t have been able to take it or i would have tried to avert it like that one azerbaijani woman did in front of our building a woman lives there an awful dissipated woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she leads two armenian families live there in her part of the building she came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse she came down to the entryway and said you ll come in this entryway over my dead body so not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn t even know what they were doing i don t think that s true they knew very well what they were doing if they didn t even lift a hand against that woman they couldn t have cared less about her but the fact that she was an azerbaijani stopped them they were just beasts they had smoked so much when they came to our place they were all chewing something i noticed everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something i think my god maybe i just think that maybe i m losing my mind but no they re all chewing something maybe it is some kind of drug it must be because at first glance they all seemed to be such normal people young clean shaven looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration but they were shouting something they didn t talk they shouted as though there were deaf people there they screamed and screamed yeah killing killing we re killing the armenians only they didn t shout kill they shouted gurun ermianlary gurun literally means kill or destroy that s how it was i ll continue we hid in a captain s apartment he s an azerbaijani his wife is a tatar we were sitting in their apartment their kids were out in the yard their kids knew a whole lot this was in our part of the building on the third floor when mamma came to and couldn t find lyuda she took papa s hand this was while the looters were stealing things but they didn t pay attention because they were stealing things apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing mamma found the courage to a boy said to my mother where s the gold mamma said he must have been to years old he even looked russian he was so fair skinned but the azerbaijanis from armenia are fair skinned i noticed they were all on the fair side he shouted they were all smashing things and he asks mamma where the gold is we kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers in a little black bag we kept everything in there mamma doesn t really like to wear gold she probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her they took everything that was lying on the cheval glass mamma thinks that the gold saved us because they threw themselves at the gold and mamma grabbed papa who was trying to breathe they had closed his mouth bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face they had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off he had something in his mouth he was having trouble breathing his nose was filled with blood mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them mamma said that by accident completely by accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said half awake what s happened he sees that they are bloody mamma said at least go and find out what s happening to my daughters even if they ve burned them or murdered them at least bring the corpses he went looking for us at that moment lyuda was under the bed she says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name when he quietly called her she couldn t get out from under the bed she wanted to get out and was calling softly she thought she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself it just seemed to her that she was shouting when she got out from under the bed everyone was gone and again she thought that she had lost her mind i ll never leave here never to hell with it it just seems that way to me i ll come to eventually but then when everything had settled down stopped that mall brought lyuda down and igor carried me in from outside or first i was brought in then lyuda i don t remember what order it happened in and mamma said listen they re all running around down there shouting something or other and running toward the other building it had more or less calmed down where we were who s dead who s alive we don t know i tried to call my girlfriend i had basically come to mamma says listen let s go upstairs at least get a mattress or something we don t know how long we ll be here maybe they didn t burn everything i don t get it all women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe not everything was taken i tell mamma mamma what do you need any of that for to hell with it we re alive forget the rest of it all of it she says no let s go get at least something maybe we ll leave here spend the night at someone else s mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son alik was standing on the lookout lie was standing there to see if they were coming they only managed to run up there and grab something one time he shouts come back they re coming they didn t have enough time to get a lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another mamma got my knitting someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore out of the hall someone took father s old coveralls the neighbor his wife mamma and papa marina went with them i was in no condition to leave neither was lyuda we just sat they ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs they re dragging something again they were going toward the other building maybe over by the school or there was an unfinished building over there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building they could gradually carry everything over there then things more or less calmed down i tried to call my boss later there was more noise we were on the third floor in a one bedroom apartment and a woman lives in the one bedroom place on the second floor asya dallakian she s an old woman retired she wasn t at home at that time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and her grandson is in the army she is only very rarely in town she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant they started pounding on her door and broke it down she had two or three beds in there something like that she s a to year old woman who really does not even live there probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses and a television when her grandson came she bought a television they started wrecking everything i started getting sick again i think my god what is going on around here when will this end we turned off the lights and sat as it turns out the people who weren t afraid the ones who knew what was going on knew not to turn off the lights we didn t know but they didn t come to where we were all the same they all knew very well that he was a captain he went out and closed the door and we sat in his apartment his last name was kasumov he s an exserviceman retired works up at the fire station at some plant or other he went out and stood at his door they tell him comrade captain don t worry we won t harm you you re one of us he went upstairs and they say aren t you taking anything from this apartment he says i don t need anything and the women who were standing in the yard we have a basement full of water the women who were standing in the yard saw those guys they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again the women threw everything they had time to into the basement to save our property some things were left dirty pillows two or three other things and a rug a guy came downstairs really mad and he says where s the rug i just put it right here they tell him some guy came and took it and went off toward the school he ran off in that direction oh i forgot the most important point when igor picked me up in his arms there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on they just didn t tell me about it for a long time the wife of that military man she didn t want to kill my spirit i was already dead enough later she told me that after they murdered uncle shurik in the third entryway one of them the ringleader apparently a young man said where s the girl who was here and he became furious the woman tells him she came to she didn t know what to say think something up someone carried her off then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family so the woman says she came to and went to the basement now our basement is full of water so the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse they took flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been standing there for years and soot and fuel oil they climbed down in there to get me then one of them said there s so much water down there she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died she met her death in the basement that s it we can leave no problem i didn t know that and when i was told i felt worse two times worse a lot worse so they didn t just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me after that we of course didn t want to live in sumgait any longer we really didn t want to go back to our apartment when we moved i went up there and started to quiver and shake all over because i started remembering it all although the neighbors all sobbed it was all so cheap the people who sat in their apartments and didn t help us at a time like that i think that they could have helped i don t think that they were obligated to but they could have helped us because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself that means they could have too it would have been enough foe one man or women to say what do you think you re doing that s all that would have done it there were apartments in our building not one person said it when i was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies i didn t hear anyone s voice no one said what are you doing leave her alone mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one armenian they would have stood up for one of their own true they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway an old sick woman tried to stop the pogrom the azerbaijanis have a custom if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground the men are supposed to stop immediately the old woman from the fourth entryway did that but they stomped her scarf into the ground pushed her off to the side and said if you want to go on living you ll disappear into your apartment so she left that trick didn t work on them even the neighbors who helped us move told me ok fine calm down forget that it happened i said i d only forget it if i told them right then that it had happened to their daughter and if that didn t have any effect on them then i would forget everything too imagine that it happened to your sister and no one did anything anything april yerevan reference the sumgait tragedy pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan volume i

org date apr gmt article i d urartu apr organization s d p a center for regional studies lines the orders for the turkish extermination of the armenians to the children of genocide send them away into the desert this is part of a continuing series of articles containing official turkish wartime ww governmental telegrams in translation entailing the orders for the extermination of the armenian people in turkey generally these telegrams were issued by the turkish minister of the interior talaat pasha for example we have the following set regarding children to the government of aleppo november we are informed that the little ones belonging to the armenians from sivas mamuret ul aziz diarbekir and erzeroum hundreds of km distance from aleppo are adopted by certain moslem families and received as servants when they are left alone through the death of their parents we inform you that you are to collect all such children in your province and send them to the places of deportation and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to the people minister of the interior talaat to the government of aleppo september there is no need for an orphanage it is not the time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans prolonging their lives send them away to the desert and inform us minister of the interior talaat to the general committee for settling and deportees november there were more than four hundred children in the orphanage they will be added to the caravans and sent to their places of exile abdullahad nuri to the government of aleppo january we hear that certain orphanages which have been opened receive also the children of the armenians whether this is done through the ignorance of our real purpose or through contempt of it the government will regard the feeding of such children or any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it purpose since it considers the survival of these children as detrimental i recommend that such children shall not be received into the orphanages and no attempts are to be made to establish special orphanages for them minister of the interior talaat to the government of aleppo collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures to which their parents have been subjected send the rest away with the caravans minister of the interior talaat from the ministry of the interior to the government of aleppo at a time when there are thousands of moslem refugees and the widows of shekid fallen soldiers are in need of food and protection it is not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by armenians who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble in the future it is necessary that these children should be turned out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of deportation those that have been kept till now are also to be sent away in compliance with our previous orders to sivas minister of the interior talaat in halide edip a pioneer turkish nationalist wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with talaat pasha verifying and rationalizing this ultra national fascist anti armenian mentality the following i have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interest and succeeds the world admires it and thinks it moral i am ready to die for what i have done and i know i shall die for it these telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the trial of talaat pasha s assassin soghomon tehlerian the turkish government never questioned these death march orders until during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the armenians for reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial the turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by s orel and s yuca of the turkish historical society if one were to examine the sample authentic text provided in the turkish historical society study and use their same forgery test on that sample it too would be a forgery in fact if any of the tests delineated by the turkish historical society are performed an any piece of ottoman turkish or persian arabic script one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery today the body of talaat pasha lies in a tomb on liberty hill istanbul turkey just next to the yildiz university campus the body of this genocide architect was returned to turkey from germany during ww when turkey was in a heightened state of proto fascism recently this monument has served as a focal point for anti armenianism in turkey this monument represents the epitome of the turkish government s pathological denial of a clear historical event and

army and its savage gangs is increasing news reporters make their living by providing stories and there is so way in hell that they are going to confuse the public with what is happening in armenia a country that few know of and risk detracting people s interest from what is happening in serbia then you must be living in an alternate universe where were they an appeal to mankind during the last three years azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the soviet union all humanitarian constitutional human rights guaranteed by the un charter universal declaration of human rights helsinki agreements human problems international forums documents signed by the soviet union all of them are violated the ussr s president government bodies do not defend azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace the strong army of armenian terrorists with moscow s tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against azerbaijan as a result a part of azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed hundreds of people killed thousands wounded some azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the armenian ssr their historical homeland together with them russians and kurds have also been driven out a part of them now settled in azerbaijan some turkish meskhetians lezghins and representatives of other caucasian nationalities who escaped from the central asia where the president and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations one of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the armenian extremists destruction of the karabakh scientific experimental base of the institute of genetics and selection of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr we beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance for the honour and dignity of million azerbaijanis are violated its territory culture and history are trampled its people are shot there is persistent negative image of azerbaijanians abroad and this defamation is spread over the whole world by soviet mass media armenian lobby in the ussr and the united states one of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of armenia on azerbaijan it is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on the issue of karabakh hundreds and thousands armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in azerbaijan land had their representatives in all government bodies of the azerbaijan ssr we are for a united indivisible sovereign azerbaijan we are for a common caucasian home proclaimed in by one of the founding fathers of the azerbaijan democratic republic muhammed emin rasulzade but all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the soviet leadership in favour of the armenian expansionists encouraged by moscow and intended to create a new year reich the great armenia by annexing the neighboring lands the world public opinion shed tears to save the whales suffers for penguins dying out in the antarctic continent but what about the lives of seven million human beings if these people are muslims does it mean that they are less valuable can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion by their residence or other attributes all people are brothers and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding this is not the first appeal of azerbaijan to the world public opinion our previous appeals were unheard however we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the russian and armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins the committee for people s help to karabakh of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr everyone knows this even the turks know this you know this give us a time period when the world is currently boring and what is happening in armenia would make front page headlines think i m lying take a look at what happened in somalia when did the press report it to the world but perhaps turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the caucasus in the name of peace and democracy the armenians are christians the azerbaijanis are moslems and islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat westernizers besides at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on azerbaijan a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent azeri people hundreds of thousands of refugees and gross violations of human rights recently armenians attacked the azeri town of khojaly and massacred thousands of azeris the paris based association for democracy and human rights in azerbaijan puts the number of khojali victims at some of the dead were scalped and mutilated this whole thing has now gone entirely too far want to know what will bring the story in armenia to the front page if the russians move into the area with a shit load of tanks then your human rights advocates will show up defending the armenians of course we can also be sure that the russians won t show up with any tanks not with the problems they are having at home they already did the scenario and genocide staged by the armenians years ago in the ottoman empire is being reenacted again this time in azerbaijan there are remarkable similarities between the plots the perpetrators and the underdogs report taken from the new york times tuesday march massacre by armenians being reported agdam azerbaijan march reuters fresh evidence emerged today of a massacre of civilians by armenian militants in nagorno karabakh a predominantly armenian enclave of azerbaijan the republic of armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed people in the azerbaijani populated town of khojaly last week and massacred men women and children fleeing the carnage across snow covered mountain passes but dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to azerbaijani reports of a massacre scalping reported azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off they said shooting by armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies women and children have been scalped said assad faradshev an aide to nagorno karabakh s azerbaijani governor when we began to pick up bodies they began firing at us the azerbaijani militia chief in agdam rashid mamedov said the bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep even the fascists did nothing like this truckloads of bodies near agdam on the outskirts of nagorno karabakh a reuters photographer frederique lengaigne said she had seen two trucks filled with azerbaijani bodies in the first one i counted and it looked as though there were as many in the second she said some had their head cut off and many had been

any name calling i started trashing any article that contains such abuses without responding to and sometimes not even reading articles written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company deleted stuff well ok let s see what master of wisdom mr jonas flygare wrote that can be wisdomely responded to are you calling names or giving me a title if the first read your paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the um well debate again i didnot know that master of wisdom can be name clling too unless you consider yourself deserve less master of wisdom writes in mar frej teknikum uu se hasan flax hasan in case you didnot know palestineans were there for months and they are coming back when you agree to give palestineans their human rights afterall human rights arenot negotiable correct me if i m wrong but isn t the right to one s life also a human right or does it only apply to palestinians no it is everybody s right however when a killer kills then he is giving up willingly or unwillingly his life s right to the society the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by depriving the killer off his life s right so then it s all right for israel to kill the people who kill israelis the old eye for an eye thinking funny i thought modern legal systems were made to counter exactly that so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom if you insist on giving me names titles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly sigh that was only to confuse you ha ha ha hey when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i m merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for some most its citizens basically revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i did explain my point in the post that you responded to the point is that since israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the occupied palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society if a state can deprive all it s citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant what kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue the answer is to be found in a certain system such as international law us law israeli law deleted jonas was throwing up not for real so you can stick to the screen it seems that the us law represented by us state dept in this case is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories anyway as for hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won t repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i m eagerly awaiting your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out davar september courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that s the english translations if you have other information i d be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i m not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but it s fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with men like joseph weitz we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by any system can be used to solve the conflict but not any system would resolve it justly guess where that takes your logic to never never land you are proving yourself as a first you understood what i meant but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic too bad for you the master of wisdom the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in if you were a zionists if you believe in zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism if you feel ashamed

have repeatedly asked you if the israelis have less human rights than the palestinians and if so why from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred that you thought so together with the above statement i then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of israel re your statement of occupation i d like you to define the term so i don t have to repeat this drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights i m sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase it if a state can deprive all it s citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant oh ok so how about the human rights of the syrians iraqis and others does the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurds in iraq and turkey how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched the russians in the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won t repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i m eagerly awaiting your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot

clock writes the latest israeli proposal first proposed in february of contains the following assumptions concerning the nature of any interim status refering to the wb and gaza the palestinians implemented by negotiations it states that israel will remain the existing source of authority until final status is agreed upon israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the interim self government arrangements isga the isga will apply to the palestinian inhabitants of the territories under israeli military administration the arrangements will not have a territorial application nor will they apply to the israeli population of the territories or to the palestinian inhabitants of jerusalem residual powers not delegated under the isga will be reserved by israel israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects external internal and for the maintenance of public order the organs of the isga will be of an administrative functional nature the exercise of powers under the isga will be subject to cooperation and coordination with israel israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education business tourism labor and social welfare local police local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious affairs the palestinian counterproposal of march the establishment of a palestinian interim self governing authority pisga whose authority is vested by the palestinian people its pisga powers cannot be delegated by israel in the interim phase the israeli military government and civil adminis tration will be abolished and the pisga will asume the powers previous ly enjoyed by israel there will be no limitations on its pisga powers and responsibilities except those which derive from its character as an interim arrangement by the time pisga is inaugurated the israeli armed forces will have completed their withdrawal to agreed points along the borders of the occupied palestinian territory opt the opt includes jerusalem the jurisdiction of the pisga shall extend to all of the opt including its land water and air space the pisga shall have legislative powers to enact amend and abrogate laws it will wield executive power withput foreign control it shall determine the nature of its cooperation with any state or international body and shall be empowered to conclude binding coopera tive agreements free of any control by israel the pisga shall administer justice throughout the opt and will have sole and exclusive jruisdiction it will have a strong police force responsible for security and public order in the opt it can request the assistance of a un peacekeeping force disputes with israel over self governing arrangements will be settled by a committee composed of representatives of the five permanent members of the un security council the secretary general of the un the pisga jordan egypt syria and israel but perhaps the bargaining attitude behind these very different visions of the interim stage is wrong for two reasons the present palestinian and israeli leadership are as moderate as is likely to exist for many years so the present opportunity may be the last for a significant period since these negotiations are not designed to or even attempting to resolve the conflict attention to issues dealing with a desired final status are mis placed and potentially destructive given this how should proposals from either side be altered to temper their maximalist approaches as stated above how can israeli worries and desire for some interim control be addressed while providing for a very real interim palestinian self governing entity tim april response by al moore l lmsc is lmsc lockheed com basically the problem is that israel may remain or leave the occupied territories it cannot do both it cannot do neither so far israe continues to propose that they remain the palestinians propose that they leave why should either change their view it is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the israeli presence israel proposes no such reduction and in fact may be said to not be negotiating tim there seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed the first is that of israel where there is little trust for arab groups so there is little support for israel giving up tangible assets in exchange for pieces of paper expectations hopes etc the second is that of the arab world palestinians where there is the demand that these tangible concessions be made by israel without it receiving anything tangible back given this the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by israel of receiving some tangible returns for its expected concessions by tangible is meant something that provides israel with comparable protection from the land it is to give up in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine will be accountable and held actively not just diplomatically responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory by citizens or visitors in essence i do not believe that israel objections to palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now if israel was assured that any new palestinian state would be committed to co existing with israel and held responsible for all attacks on israel from its territory aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above how could such guarantees be instilled for example how could such guarantees controls be added to the palestinian pisga proposals israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go gives lands back to arab states no more buffer zone gives full autonomy to palestinians any and or all of the arab parties could and would if not controlled somehow easily return to the traditional anti israel position the question then is how to really ensure that that will not happen tim,talk.politics.mideast

caucasus organized to fight the turks these chieftains have been more successful in their fight against their armenian opponents in turkey and the caucasus very often defenseless and innocent p the fact remains however that the leaders of the turkish armenian section of the dashnagtzoutune did not carry out their promise of loyalty to the turkish cause when the turks entered the war and a call was sent for armenian volunteers to fight the turks on the caucasian front p thousands of armenians from all over the world flocked to the standards of such famous fighters as antranik kery dro etc the armenian volunteer regiments rendered valuable service to the russian army in the years of source adventures in the near east by a rawlinson jonathan cape bedford square london first published

by the armenian soldiery in kars plain and as i had been able to judge of their want of discipline by their treatment of my own detached parties i had wired to tiflis from zivin that in the interests of humanity the armenians should not be left in independent command of the moslem population as their troops being without discipline and not under effective control atrocities were constantly being committed for which we should with justice eventually be held to be morally responsible p third paragraph armenian troops who having pillaged and destroyed all the moslem villages in the plain caravans of refugees were in the meanwhile constantly arriving from the plain from which the whole moslem population was fleeing with as much of their personal property as they could transport seeking to obtain security and protection p first paragraph in those moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched for arms by the armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of such search and not only had many moslems been killed but horrible tortures had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as to where valuables had been hidden of which the armenians were aware of the existence although they had been unable to find them p first paragraph shortly afterwards the head of the miserable column appeared there were in all about persons mostly old men and women and children with a few ox carts ponies and donkeys carrying all their worldly possessions except a few sheep that they were driving before them their leader interviewed bekir bey and was told to keep farther on into the hills where he would be able to cross the frontier into turkey unmolested by his enemies p first paragraph the armenians from the plain were attacking the kurdish line with artillery with probably a large force in support p first paragraph the arrival of this british brigade was followed by the announcement that kars province had been allotted by the supreme council of the allies to the armenians and that announcement having been made the british troops were then completely withdrawn and armenian occupation commenced hence all the trouble for the armenians at once

likes furthering himself from any name calling i started trashing any article that contains such abuses without responding to and sometimes not even reading articles written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company ah but in my followup on the subject which you by the way never bothered responding to there was no name calling hence the assumption do you feel more up to it now so that we might have an answer or to refresh your memory does the human right issue in the area apply to palestinians only also do you claim there is such a thing as forfeiting a human right if that s possible then explain to the rest of us how there can exist any such thing use your logic and convince us this is your golden chance jonas flygare well ok let s see what master of wisdom mr jonas

debate again master of wisdom writes in mar frej teknikum uu se hasan flax hasan in case you didnot know palestineans were there for months and they are coming back when you agree to give palestineans their human rights afterall human rights arenot negotiable correct me if i m wrong but isn t the right to one s life also a human right or does it only apply to palestinians no it is everybody s right however when a killer kills then he is giving up willingly or unwillingly his life s right to the society the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by depriving the killer off his life s right so then it s all right for israel to kill the people who kill israelis the old eye for an eye thinking funny i thought modern legal systems were made to counter exactly that so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom if you insist on giving me names titles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly sigh when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i m merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i did explain my point in the post that you responded to the point is that since israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the occupied palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society if a state can deprive all it s citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all in conjugtion with the above when a group of people occupies others territories and rule them by force then this group would be willingly or unwillingly deprived from some of its rights such as the right to live that s nice the swedish government is a group of people that rule me by force does that give me the right to kill them do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here worthy or not i was just applying your logic to a related problem am i to assume you admit it wouldn t hold what kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue the answer is to be found in a certain system such as international law us law israeli law and now it s very convenient to start using the legal system to prove a point excuse me while i throw up ok master of wisdom is throwing up you people stay away from the screen while he is doing it oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone i ll let you in on a secret it s not for real take my word for it it seems that the us law represented by us state dept in this case is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories anyway as for hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won t repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i m eagerly awaiting your reply joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out davar september courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that s the english translations if you have other information i d be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i m not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but it s fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region ever it s those who are willing to make a tabula rasa and start over and willing to give in order to get something back we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction guess where that takes your logic to never never land the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit jonas flygare

the places which were then taken over by armenian gangs the russians usually treated the people well but the people feared the intervention of the armenians once these places had been taken over by the armenians however the massacres begun they clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the armenian and kurdish land from the turks and thus solve the nationality problem today

x soviet armenian government got away with the genocide of million turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide and they are doing it again are you so blind problem is everybody arab greek bulgar serb russian tartar circassian persian kurd is or has been an opponent who has been kurds r us armenians r not an ally this historic circumstance seems to have taken a certain toll on serdar perhaps he should be posting to alt raving nationalist rather than soc history excuse me we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination our troops surrounded village after village little resistance was offered our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work some of the tartars escaped of course they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey the rest were killed and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead ohanus appressian men are like that p a genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an attempt to exterminate a race this is the worst crime in history it happened to the turks in eastern anatolia and the armenian dictatorship million turks and kurds were killed in the worst ways imaginable it is sickening to think that the human race is capable of such actions but there is no denying the fact that the armenian genocide of million muslims happened people of turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were killed in the turkish genocide i understand their anger that there are those who still deny that the turkish genocide indeed took place despite the fact that the genocide of million turks has been well documented over the past six decades we cannot reverse the events of the past but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the atlantic so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race source bristol papers general correspondence container bristol to bradley letter of september i have it from absolute first hand information that the armenians in the caucasus attacked tartar turkish villages that are utterly defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder the inhabitants pillage the village and often burn the village lets get somethings straight why not armenians are no angels but they were subject to turkish genocide and the germans were subject to jewish genocide are you for real tell me halsall were you high on asala sdpa arf forgeries and fabrications when you wrote that where is your non existent list of scholars here is mine during the first world war and the ensuing years the armenian dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries old policy of annihilation against the turks and kurds by savagely murdering million muslims and deporting the rest from their year homeland the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the th century acted upon an entire people this event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government and international political leaders such as u s ambassador mark bristol william langer ambassador layard james barton stanford shaw arthur chester john

mark alan epstein the ottoman jewish communities and their role in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries klaus schwarz werlag freiburg page during the fifteenth century when the ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the balkans there was considerable turmoil among the jewish communities in central and western europe even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized it is easy to understand the attraction which ottoman life particularly when compared to life in europe held for the jews there is no way to tell how many jews left christendom for the realm of the rising muslim ottomans but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from christian countries it is recorded that some jews fled to ottoman territory the regularity of these reports suggests that the ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of jewish families moving southward and eastward from western and central europe it is evident that the effects of plague late crusades and the general intolerance and persecution of jews in christian europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of jewish life which for more than two centuries was to be oriented toward muslim east page in the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the edirne jewish community was rabbi yitzhak sarfati the ashkenazi chief rabbi of the city he was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the edirne jewry in the fifteenth century sarfati himself was from christian europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there who upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the ottoman jews prevailed upon him to write their european coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate this remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the ottoman domains but described as well the ease of travel to palestine and the holy places an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there page the impression gained from the hebrew sources is that the jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the ottomans especially in comparison to relations with the christians of europe confirmation of the commonality of interests between muslims and jews is also indicated by the fact that european christians perceived the jews as allies of islam and were well aware of muslim jewish cooperation certainly the activity of important jewish financiers and politicians representing the ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed european sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers in addition it appears that christian pirates plundered turks and jews their sworn enemies and that europeans considered the jews to be agents who regularly reported to the ottomans there are well known examples of overt jewish support for the ottomans in the struggle against european powers the two best known instances of jewish support for the campaigning ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the jewish contributions to the conquests of buda in the early sixteenth century and of rhodes we also have reports of sympathy for the ottomans during the siege of chios an unpublished ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some greek towns page it is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of jews and muslims coincided frequently and all parties involved jews muslims and christians were aware of the situation page it seems that the relations between greeks and jews were not particularly cordial the two groups had little in common few common interests and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation rather than enmity if there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was that between muslims and jews neither of whom had much in common with the orthodox page the general impression of muslim jewish relations in the ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests from the earliest times the ottomans seem to have welcomed jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element the jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of jews from christian countries to ottoman domains page from the period before we have only a few indications that the ottoman jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward but the liberality of the ottomans in contrast to the intolerance of the byzantines and the protection and the security which the ottomans offered in comparison to conditions elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the ottomans and the jews recognized their mutual interests page it is impossible to say how fundamental the jews were in the success of the ottomans in rebuilding istanbul or in ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century that they played an important role in both cannot be doupted it is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the ottomans as well as did the jews it is however unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between jews and the non jewish society in which they lived we must conclude that the ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the jews did certainly for the jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the ottoman empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home a version of rabbi sarfati s tzarfati letter is given by prof shaw page your cries and sobs reached us we have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the german lands i hear the lamentation of my brethren the barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people the priests and prelates of rome have risen they wish to root out the memory of jacob and erase the name of israel they always devise new persecutions they wish to bring you to the stake listen my brethren to the counsel i will give you i too was born in germany and studied torah with the german rabbis i was driven out

complain of we possess great fortunes much gold and silver in our hands we are not oppressed with heavy taxes and our commerce is free and unhindered rich are the fruits of the earth everything is cheap and every one of us lives in peace and freedom here the jew is not compelled to wear a yellow hat as a badge of shame as is the case in germany where even wealth and great fortune are a curse for a jew because he therewith arouses jealousy among the christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him to rob him of his gold arise my brethren gird up your loins collect your forces

varnavas a lambrou writes what about cyprus the majority of the population is christian but your fellow turkish friends did and still doing a good job for you by cleaning the area from christians all your article reflects is your abundant ignorance the people of turkiye know quite well that greece and the greek cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with greece someday whatever the cost to the parties involved the history speaks for itself greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on july in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of archibishop makarios following the greek cypriot attempt to annex the island to greece with the aid of the greek army turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island turkish cypriots for those turkish cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since the release of nikos sampson a member of eoka national organization of cypriot fighters and a convicted terrorist shows that the enosis mentality continues to survive in greece one should not forget that sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the turks in cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to destroy the island s independence by annexing it to greece of course the greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct the museum of barbarism irfan bey street kumsal area nicosia cyprus it is the house of dr nihat ilhan a major who was serving at the cyprus turkish army contingent during the attacks launched against the turks by the greeks on th december dr nihat ilhan s wife and three children were ruthlessly and brutally killed in the bathroom where they had tried to hide by savage greeks dr nihat ilhan happened to be on duty that night the th december pictures reflecting greek atrocities committed during and after are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum an eye witness account of how a turkish family was butchered by greek terrorists the date is the th of december the onslaught of the greeks against the turks which started three days ago has been going on with all its ferocity and defenseless women old men and children are being brutally killed by greeks and now kumsal area of nicosia witnesses the worst example of the greeks savage bloodshed the wife and the three infant children of dr nihat ilhan a major on duty at the camp of the cyprus turkish army contingent are mercilessly and dastardly shot dead while hiding in the bathroom of their house by maddened greeks who broke into their home a glaring example of greek barbarism let us now listen to the relating of the said incident told by mr hasan yusuf gudum an eye witness who himself was wounded during the same terrible event on the night of the th of december my wife feride hasan and i were paying a visit to the family of major dr nihat ilhan our neighbours mrs ayshe of mora her daughter ishin and mrs ayshe s sister novber were also with us we were all sitting having supper all of a sudden bullets from the pedieos river direction started to riddle the house sounding like heavy rain thinking that the dining room where we were sitting was dangerous we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought would be safer altogether we were nine persons we all hid in the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet we waited in fear mrs ilhan the wife of major doctor was standing in the bath with her three children murat kutsi and hakan in her arms suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open greeks had come in and were combing every corner of the house with their machine gun bullets during these moments i heard voices saying in greek you want taksim eh and then bullets started flying in the bathroom mrs ilhan and her three children fell into the bath they were shot at this moment the greeks who broke into the bathroom emptied their guns on us again i heard one of the major s children moan then i fainted when i came to myself or hours later i saw mrs ilhan and her three children lying dead in the bath i and the rest of the neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded but what had happened to my wife then i remembered and immediately ran to the toilet where in the doorway i saw her body she was brutally murdered in the street admist the sound of shots i heard voices crying help help is there no one to save us i became terrified i thought that if the greeks came again and found that i was not dead they would kill me so i ran to the bedroom and hid myself under the double bed an our passed by in the distance i could still hear shots my mouth was dry so i came out from under the bed and drank some water then i put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the bathroom which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago there i offered sweets to mrs ayshe her daughter and mrs novber who were all wounded we waited in the bathroom until o clock in the morning i thought morning would never come we were all wounded and needed to be taken to hospital finally as we could walk mrs novber and i went out into the street hoping to find help and walked as far as koshklu chiftlik there we met some people who took us to hospital where we were operated on when i regained my consciousness i said that there were more wounded in the house and they went and brought mrs ayshe and her daughter after staying three days in the hospital i was sent by plane to ankara for further treatment there i have had four months treatment but still i cannot use my arm on my return to cyprus greeks arrested

is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal nazi armenians of the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle now try dealing with the rest of what i wrote what is more the activities of the armenian government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race the turks or aimed at carrying out a one sided feud instead of being a struggle for liberation from the outset the efforts of the armenian revolutionaries within the ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder cruelty and genocide so that no other interpretation of them is possible armenian activities started during the reign of abdulhamid ii as individual acts of terror and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks the element of brute force in these activities increased steadily culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the first world war furthermore when the ottoman army withdrew from eastern anatolia after the sarikamis defeat armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area although the russians occupied eastern anatolia as an enemy nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war however when they returned to their country in after the revolution armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the ottoman forces returned to erzurum in during this period armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents for example let us look at a report dated march which the commander of the third army submitted when he entered erzurum and erzincan they were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by armenians even the trees were cut down and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word as for the people who had been living in erzurum and erzincan those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken in the direction of sarikamis and annihilated when the russian army withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in armenian massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells they were locked in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act a very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to including women and children such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in erzincan and thirty thousand in erzurum all the fields in erzincan and erzurum are untilled everything that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them in a destitute situation at the present time the people are subsisting on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area foreign observers who witnessed the events including russian officers who did not desert their lines submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war what is most important is that they stated in their reports the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned at the end of the war the german author dr weiss his austrian colleague dr stein and his turkish colleague mr ahmet vefik visited trabzon kars erzurum and batum between april

microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan really people in town didn t know what was happening on february i came home from school at o clock being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to baku when we left everything in town was fine life was the same as usual a few groups of people were discussing things soccer and other things then we got on the sumgait bus bound for baku for my first cousin s birthday my father my mother and i we spent the day in baku and on the th somewhere around p m we got on the bus for home figuring that i d have enough time to do my homework for the next day when we were entering town near the story high rises our bus was stopped by a very large crowd the crowd demanded that the armenians get off the bus the driver says that there are no armenians on board then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no armenians on board the group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one not checking passports just going by the way people look we get off the bus but are not taken for armenians we set out in the direction of home at first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there d be a place to hide but the whole road was packed with groups of people all the way from block to the th microdistrict these groups were emptying people s pockets and checking passports people who didn t have passports with them were beaten as well then we decided to go home instead near the story high rises i saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways yelling death to the armenians was written on the cars when we came into the courtyard we live in an l shaped building it was still quiet we went on upstairs but didn t turn on any lights we tried to call baku to warn our relatives who were due to arrive on wednesday not to come then there was a knock at the door it was our neighbors who advised us to come down to stay at their place we went down to their place and they led us to the basement they live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony we sat in the basement while an armenian woman was beaten she ran away naked our neighbors daughter said that that s right that s what the armenians deserve because in stepanakert allegedly people were being killed girls from agdam had been raped we didn t stay very long in the basement we tried to support one another as best we could looking out the small window with the iron grating papa watched and said things now and then he said that there was a fire near building probably a car on fire then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where armenians lived the neighbors said that there weren t any armenians here and the group set out for the other wing of the building they appeared from the side of the building where i later found out a woman had been murdered the woman who ran away naked died yuri avakian was killed too when the crowd left the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home we went back up to our place and again didn t turn on the light we started to gather up our things in order to leave sumgait for a while we tried to call a relative who lived in sumgait but there was no answer we decided she had already left we sat at home the phone rang and the caller asked to speak with my father i called him to the phone it was jeykhun mamedov from my father s work brigade he said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town he asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city to be quite honest papa didn t want to give him our address but my mother got on the phone and told him some minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway bursting into the building they broke down the door and came into the apartment they came straight to our apartment they knew exactly where the armenians were they came into our place we tried to resist but there was nothing we could do one of them took my parents passports and began to read them he read the surname danielian turned the page read armenian and that alone was enough to doom us he said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard where they would have done with us another standing next to him pushed some of the keys on the piano and said your death has tolled they had knives and steel truncheons i had a knife in my hand unfortunately i didn t use it i just knew that if i didn t give up the knife things would be much worse they struck my parents and said that i should put the knife on the piano then one of them commanded that we be taken outside one person was giving orders when we were taken outdoors i went in the middle and my mother was behind me someone started to push her so she d walk faster i let her go ahead of me and fell in behind her when he tried to push me i hit him and at that moment they began beating my parents i realized that resistance was completely useless we are taken out into the courtyard and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next the crowd surrounds us at first they strike me and i m knocked out when i come to they beat me again i lose consciousness often i don t see or hear my parents since i was the first one hit and was out cold when i come to i try to pick them up they are lying next to me the crowd is gone the only people around are watching from their balconies that s it i try to pick them up but can t my left arm is broken i start toward the drive wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance the bodies of my parents are still warm we were attacked at around o clock i regain consciousness at about and try to make it up the stairs home when i knock at the neighbors door they push me back and tell me to go away i go up to the third floor our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment i often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived but i can t see very far as a result of the blows and it seems that my parents have already been taken away then i calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away and everything will be ok but they were still there later at in the morning as i found out the ambulance picked them up but they were already dead if they received attention on time it is possible they would still be alive later around o clock on the th policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some assistants they call an ambulance and minutes later it arrives and i am taken to the sumgait emergency hospital there they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm at o clock i and the other armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to baku in my ward at the sumgait hospital there were five people all of them armenians the hospital was nearly overflowing with armenians the only azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events before the th then i was in the semashko hospital in baku i was there days when i was released on the th day i found out that my parents were dead at first they told me that they were in moscow being treated but later i found out that they were dead my father s older brother told me my father s name was nikolai artemovich danielian he was born in my mother born in was seda osipovna danielian papa worked at pmk the leader of the roofing brigade mamma was a compressor operator they were also beaten on the head the coroner s report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely at the confrontation i met jeykhun mamedov who had called as it turned out later he had been the one who tipped the crowd off he had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group he knew the phone number but didn t know the address before the events i had never seen him but had often spoken with him on the phone when he would ask to speak with my father i knew him by name he denies that i was the one who answered the phone saying that my father answered it he denies that he called from a public phone saying that he called from home which also isn t true i heard noise and the sounds of automobiles as i later found out earlier he had been convicted but had never served any time he had received a suspended sentence he was about years old i don t know if he has since confessed or not i am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off one hundred percent sure my parents were from karabagh father was from the village of badar and was two years old when his family moved to baku where his elder brothers were to go to school he was a student at the naval school but never graduated he went off to work on the virgin lands one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under khrushchev when he returned he lived in baku and later moved to sumgait helping with the town s construction mamma was from the village of dagdagan also from karabagh she worked in sumgait first in a bookstore and later on a construction site my sister is older than i she lives with her husband here in karabagh i always loved my parents that was why i went on to th grade because it was their dream that i would continue my studies i finished th grade and wanted to enter the baku nautical school and after that the military school but later i changed my mind or rather my parents got me to recon sider saying that it would be better to finish the th grade and then join the naval school i was planning to be in the navy almost my whole life long since childhood i had dreamed of being a sailor my father wanted it more than anything he always recollected his youth telling of the school and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it now i live in karabagh and never plan to leave here i will stay at the home of my grandfather of my ancestors till the end of my days while in the hospital in baku i learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well like ishkhan trdatov he managed to hold them off at their residence in microdistrict building apartment for a long time lost his father gabriel and by some miracle managed to survive i also learned of uncle sasha from building whose daughter was raped besides them valery i forgot his last name was in the hospital too about a year younger than i he went to school no he was riding with his parents in the car people were throwing rocks at them he was hit and his parents brought him to the hospital and he was in our ward we even came to be friends before that we had just seen each other around town but in the hospital we got to know one another better i learned of the fates of others those who had died or who were befallen by misfortune today suren harutunian the first secretary of the communist party of armenia was shown on television to be honest i am glad that armenia agreed to recognize nagorno karabagh as part of the armenian soviet socialist republic i was repelled no revolted to hear the baku announcer who read the decision of the azerbaijani supreme soviet presidium against karabagh becoming part of armenia after the events in sumgait and those in baku the best solution is to give karabagh to armenia return it to armenia since the people want to live peacefully with the azerbaijanis but everything has to be right before they can do that i arrived in karabagh on april i felt very bad i had constant headaches after a while my strength returned my older sister suzanna took me in i think that justice should prevail the people are demanding their due you can t take away what is their due my parents and i often spoke of nagorno karabagh often visited here spent almost all of my vacations here we had even decided that if karabagh would be made part of armenia we would move here for sure we always said that the armenian people had suffered much and that what had been done in removing nagorno karabagh from armenia was wrong sooner or later mistakes should be corrected and in order to correct a mistake it must not be repeated and the fate of all

recently completed two books the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic and turkey and the holocaust turkey s role in rescuing turkish and european jewry from nazi persecution shaw chairs the undergraduate interdepartmental degree program in near eastern studies and has organized the program for the study of ottoman and turkish jewry he is affiliated with the g e von grunebaum center for near eastern studies editor how did you come to write these two books on turkey and european and turkish jews shaw basically i m an ottoman historian but i m also jewish i ve spent twenty five years studying ottoman history and as time went along whenever i found materials on the ottoman jews i collected them but i never did anything with them until a couple of years ago when i suddenly realized that was the th anniversary of the jews being expelled from spain and coming to turkey then the sephardic temple down on wilshire avenue invited me to give a series of three lectures on ottoman jewry these lectures were greatly appreciated and i became motivated to undertake further research to develop a book the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic this book is quite different from the works of most jewish historians who tend to look at the jews in any country more from the viewpoint of the jews and the jewish community and rely mainly on jewish sources i view my subject as an ottoman historian and i approach the jews of the ottoman empire largely from the point of view of ottoman society using largely ottoman sources after i finished this book and sent it to the press i came across additional documents relating to turkish jews during world war ii in the completed book i had said that turkey had done a good deal to rescue the jews during world war ii but i did not actually have many details then i found a batch of documents in the foreign ministry archive relating to actions taken by turkish diplomats to help the jews before and during the holocaust it was too late to add this new information to the book in press so i decided to write a second book i conducted further research mainly in the archives of the foreign ministry in ankara and the turkish embassy and consulate in paris the result was the second book turkey and the holocaust which details how turkey helped rescue jews from the nazis how exactly did they do this the story takes place over a number of years the book presents the material in three parts first of which deals with the period before the holocaust when the nazis came to power in germany in they immediately started dismissing jews and anti nazi germans from universities hospitals scientific institutes and the like turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its universities and it saw in these jews who were being fired from their positions in germany a good source of new talent to help modernize the turkish universities within three months after the nazis started dismissing these jews turkey arranged to take many of them in they were brought to turkey and were given appointments as professors in the turkish universities as heads of scientific institutes and as medical personnel in hospitals about to major jewish professors came to turkey in the s ernst reuter a german political scientist spent the war years teaching political science in turkey after world war ii he was mayor of berlin during the berlin airlift fritz neimark a major german jewish economist came to turkey and helped establish a modern school of economics in istanbul a man named reichenbach who was rescued from the nazis by turkey and spent the war years in turkey eventually came to ucla where he became a professor of philosophy other german jewish emigres engaged in cultural activities in turkey one such was karl ebert who had been a leading theatrical producer in berlin until he was expelled by the nazis he went to turkey where he organized the turkish national theater and the turkish national opera company in ankara with the help of paul hindemuth so the first section of the book covers this first phase when jews were being persecuted in germany and rescued by turkey oddly enough the german emigres when they were in turkey did not seem to think too badly of germany they regarded themselves more as germans than jews and they did not join in the anti nazi activities of the local turkish jewish community i even found letters from the nazi representatives to turkey praising these german jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea of german culture even though these people had been persecuted by the nazis and rescued by the turks they shared the nazis feelings of aryan racial superiority over the turks the second part of the book deals with the holocaust which began in when the nazis occupied france in europe at that time and especially in france there were about turkish jews they had migrated to europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward most of them had settled in europe during the turkish war for independence after world war i when greece was threatening to overrun turkey the greeks had persecuted the jews throughout the nineteenth century and the jews feared what might happen to them if the greeks took over in turkey many jews fled to france during the s and s many also abandoned their turkish citizenship and became french citizens suddenly the nazis invaded france in and started introducing all sorts of anti jewish laws the turkish jews soon found that it was not worth very much to be a french jew but that it was worth a lot to be a turkish jew how so turkey remained neutral through most of world war ii it retained its embassies and consulates in all the nazi occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the allies at the end of during the war therefore turkey was in a position to defend its citizens against anti jewish measures and the actions that turkish diplomats took form the second chapter of the book turkish diplomats who were stationed in france in particular intervened to protect jews of turkish citizenship from the nazis for those turkish jews who had retained their turkish citizenship there was generally no problem if they were arrested and sent to a concentration camp the turkish diplomats would communicate with the commanders of the camp and other officials and say in effect these people are turkish citizens you can t do this to them and the turkish jews would be released if their businesses were confiscated the turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored the nazis in general wanted to keep the friendship of turkey they hoped to be able to use turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the middle east and they also wanted to obtain chromium and manganese from turkey in order to keep turkish friendship they usually accepted these interventions on behalf of turkish jews the turkish diplomats sometimes went to the concentration camps to secure the release of turkish jews at times they even boarded trains hauling turkish jews to auschwitz for extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train most of the foreign jews were sent to a concentration camp at a place called drancy in paris and that s where most of the intercession by turkish consuls took place the greater problem came with the turkish jews who had abandoned their turkish citizenship and had become french citizens the consuls couldn t declare that these people were turkish citizens because they were not my book includes photographs of jews lining up in front of the turkish consulate either to get passports to return to turkey or to get a restoration of their turkish citizenship this was a bureaucratic matter so processing the application would take some time in the meantime it was a real emergency because the nazis would arrest jews on the streets for almost nothing the nazis would even arrest them if they had radios or telephones in their apartments because radios and telephones were forbidden to jews to take care of these former turkish jews the turkish diplomats invented a document called gayri muntazem vatandash or irregular fellow citizen the document said in effect this person is a former turkish citizen who has applied for the restoration of his turkish citizenship in the meantime we would appreciate it if you would treat him as if he were a turkish citizen the diplomats wrote the document in turkish and put their seals on it since the nazis could not read turkish on the whole they accepted these papers as certificates of citizenship by this means the turkish diplomats were able to rescue many jews who had relinquished their turkish citizenship actually the nazis were of two minds about the turkish defense of jews on the one hand the nazi foreign ministry which wanted to retain the friendship of turkey was in favor of accepting these interventions on the other hand himmler and eichmann wanted all jews exterminated at times himmler and eichmann were able to prevail and some of the turkish jews were sent off to auschwitz before the turkish consuls could do anything do you have statistics on how many turkish jews were rescued there were about turkish jews in europe before world war ii about of whom were living in france most of the information in this section of the book relates to the situation in france i have published the letters that the turkish consuls sent to the nazi officials and the letters that came back in reply generally the nazis said that if the turkish consul would present documents certifying that arrested individuals are turkish citizens and promise to send them out of france the nazis would release them from the concentration camp the turkish consuls also organized special trains to take turkish jews from nazi occupied territory back to turkey these trains ran regularly in and the nazis gave the turkish jews visas so they could pass out of nazi territory but the trains were often held up by the nazi influenced governments of eastern europe croatia serbia and bulgaria because these governments really didn t want the jews to escape as a result of the turkish consuls efforts about to of the turkish jews in france were saved another were sent off to auschwitz where most of them died the remaining either escaped across the border into spain or fled to the area of southern france occupied by the italians who treated jews much better than the nazis did at the end of however italy fell out of the war and that was the end for those jews as well incidentally the turkish diplomats in nazi occupied greece also worked to rescue jews in that country the second part of your book then deals with turkish diplomats acting to rescue jews of turkish citizenship or turkish origin from nazi persecution yes and there is an aside i might add here in their interventions on behalf of turkish jews the turks cited their treaty with germany which stated that turkish citizens in german territory would be treated the same as german citizens in turkey on that basis the turks maintained that the nazis could not discriminate against turkish citizens who are jews the nazis claimed and the vichy government agreed that they were not discriminating because they were treating all jews equally turkey protested saying you are dividing our citizens according to religion but the turkish constitution requires that all citizens be treated equally regardless of religion therefore you cannot single out turkish jews american consuls in paris by contrast accepted the nazi argument and told american jews who were being persecuted by the nazis that they couldn t do anything about it because the american jews were being treated the same as other jews the third part of the book takes place in turkey which was the principal center during the holocaust for activities aimed at the rescue of eastern european jews the kwish agency an organization established by jews in palestine to help resettle jews to palestine set up an office in istanbul in under the leadership of chaim barlas other jewish organizations in palestine especially the kibbutzes also sent representatives to istanbul to set up headquarters these groups first tried to contact jews in eastern europe to find out what was happening today we know about the holocaust but at that time people didn t know what was going on they didn t imagine the nazis could do the things they were doing and so the first step was to get information and the turkish government let them use the turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends in eastern europe the jewish organizations found out what was happening when they received replies later on when the nazis began to intercept such letters the jews received assistance also from the vatican nuncio angelo roncali who served as the vatican representative in istanbul from to and later became pope john xxiii as the vatican representative during the war he used the facilities of the catholic church to supplement what the turkish government was doing to assist jewish agencies in contacting jews in eastern europe with the cooperation of the turkish government these agencies then sent hard currency food clothing and even railroad and steamship tickets to jews in czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and hungary they weren t able to help much in poland because by then the nazis had wiped out almost all the polish jews whenever possible the rescue agencies arranged for the jews to get out of eastern europe either by train through the so called orient express route to istanbul or by boat through the black sea to istanbul turkey was not eager for all these refugees to remain within its borders during the war because it was being blockaded and was suffering terrible shortages of food and clothing the government therefore facilitated the movement of the non turkish jewish refugees from turkey to palestine either by the taurus express railroad through the mountains to syria and palestine or by small boats across the eastern mediterranean from southern turkey to palestine these efforts were bitterly opposed not only by the nazis but also by the british who did not want any more jewish immigration to palestine because they feared it would hurt their relations with the arabs the british constantly pressured the turkish government to stop this traffic and send those jews back in a few cases the turkish government yielding to british pressure did send the boats back for example in one incident the steamship struma with some jewish refugees from romania was sent back by the turkish government as a result of the intervention of the british ambassador when that ship was sunk by a soviet submarine all were lost except one person nevertheless all told the turkish government allowed no fewer than eastern european jews to pass through turkish territory and move on to palestine during the second world war the turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities and money and gave them permission to send money and food out of the country many of these jews who passed through turkey may still be living in israel yes and their children but let s return for a moment to the first group the turkish jews who came from europe they did not go on to palestine they stayed in turkey it was the non turkish eastern european jews who passed through turkey en route to palestine their story is very interesting and you have rescued it from obscurity many studies have been made of the holocaust but most of them do not focus on the eastern european or middle eastern jews most of the scholarship has centered on the western european jews of whom million were massacred by the nazis my study deals with a much smaller number of people i have tried to round out the picture and i hope my book will persuade other scholars to undertake further investigations in the history of eastern jews when it comes to numbers the german jews were also relatively small in number most of the millions slain were polish jews the rescue of eastern european jews may not seem so significant compared with the total of million who were murdered but it meant a lot to those who were saved about three fourths of the book consists of documents translations of many documents they are included because the story is not well known not only are people in the west unaware of the courageous actions of the turkish diplomats even the people of turkey did not know the story i felt that they would not fully understand this remarkable achievement unless they could see the documents what languages are used in the documents most of them are in turkish or french some are in hebrew there is a great deal of material in hebrew about the organization of the boats going to palestine the passengers and so on but i did not go into those details extensively i describe mostly what turkey did so most of my documents are in turkish or french a few documents are in english the jewish groups in istanbul did not necessarily cooperate with one another to rescue jews in fact they often fought with one another they took turns trying to get the turkish government to deport rival groups for example some of the kibbutz groups felt that the jewish agency was run by western european jews who were interested only in helping western european jews finally in president roosevelt sent a personal representative ira hirschman who had been an executive of bloomingdale s department store in new york city and hirschman managed to reconcile their differences the documents related to his mission are in english i also obtained many documents from serge klarsfeld a holocaust historian in france who mainly worked on the french jews his father was killed by the nazis he gave me materials he had gathered in the german archives on the turkish jews so i didn t personally consult the german archives i believe that much more can be learned from the german archives and i hope someone someday will make the effort this new book fits in well with your teaching doesn t it right i m giving a course on the history of the jews of the ottoman empire i first gave the course two years ago in addition to research writing and teaching i ve been actively involved in the commemoration of the th anniversary of the coming of the jews to the ottoman empire among other things i helped organize a large international conference on the subject which was held in istanbul in now that your books are finished and the conference has taken place what do you plan to do next i m working on two new books one is a history of the turkish war for independence which took place after world war i during the years to the turks warded off the efforts of the victorious european powers to occupy turkey and end its independence the second book is a study of sultan abdul hamid ii the last major sultan who ruled from to he was an

the same time working to sabotage the ottoman army s war effort by destroying roads and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to ease russian occupation the atrocities committed by the armenian volunteer forces accompanying the russian army were so severe that the russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear

like conversing with a brick wall and you are not responding to what i am writing by the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the th century acted upon an entire people for nearly one thousand years the turkish and kurdish people lived on their homeland the last one hundred under the oppressive soviet and armenian occupation the persecutions culminated in the armenian government planned and carried out a genocide against its muslim subjects million turks and kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland after one thousand years turkish

do not autopost the same block of text about the turkish genocide remember the issue at hand is the armenian nazi collaboration during world war ii and the turkish genocide and i still fail to see how you can challenge the following western sources source john dewey the new republic vol nov pp happy the minority jews which has had no christian nation to protect it and one recalls that the jews took up their abode in fanatic turkey when they were expelled from europe especially spain by saintly christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers to one brought up as most americans have been in the gladstonian and foreign missionary tradition the condition of the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable one readily reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate he also stated that they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population i want the documents of jews in latvia i think several other people on soc culture greek are already disputing with you about the turkish genocide is this

garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the ottoman empire and to assist instead other invading russian armies their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories armenian

someone else or do not reply to my posts argic my love i am not arguing about the armenian nazi collaboration i do not give a thunder about it i want you to do one of three things a admit that you are not a regular user but a computer autoposting turkish propaganda or b post the documents on jews in latvia or c run away like the coward without a real address that you are and do not reply to my posts it could be perhaps your head wasn t screwed on just right in while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration camps the armenian volunteers in germany formed the first armenian battalion to fight alongside the nazis in this battalion had grown into eight battalions of strong under the command of the former guerilla leader dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the short lived armenian dictatorship and the architect of the cold blooded genocide of million turks and kurds between an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party leaders in berlin which was recognized by the nazis encouraged by this the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler s policy of extermination of the jews this armenian nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an encore performance staged by the armenians during wwi when they back stabbed and exterminated million turks by colluding with the invading russian army furthermore as mccarthy put it the armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the ottomans admitted defeat and signed the mudros armistice with the allies october the allies had decided to create a greater armenia including the old russian province of yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of anatolia claimed by the armenian fanatics only the area called cilicia around the ottoman province of adana was to be excluded as it had already been claimed by the french the allies quickly set about attempting to disarm ottoman soldiers and other turks who could be expected to oppose their plans on april the british army occupied kars gave civilian and military power over to the armenians then withdrew the british planned for kars to be included in the armenian dictatorship even though the russian pre war census had shown kars province to be over muslim the turks of kars were effectively disarmed but the british could not disarm the kurds of the mountains the fate of the turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in eastern anatolia murder pillage genocide and the destruction of turkish homes and entire turkish villages drove the turks of kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the ottoman army the british had left the scene to the armenian genocide squads therefore few europeans were present to observe the genocide one british soldier colonel rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of otoman soldiers saw what was occurring rawlinson wired to his superiors in the interest of humanity the armenians should not be left in independent command of the moslim population as their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control atrocities were constantly being committed instead you post more armenian

clear statements of reliable eyewitnesses was also confirmed by general odishelidje commander of the russian caucasian army armenians are entering every place evacuated by russians carrying out murders cruelties rape and all kind of atrocities which cannot be expressed in writing murdering all the women children aged people who happen to be in the street these barbarous murders repeated

shocking we have decided to inform all our friends urgently about the situation document no archive no cabin no drawer no file no section no contents no to acting supreme command commander rd army general the situation in the cities of erzincan and erzurum which we have recently taken over is given below these two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the calamities and destruction which they suffered have been destroyed as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of these cities were deliberately burnt by armenians apart from the destruction suffered during the two year russian occupation all barracks buildings of erzincan the cavalry barracks in erzurum the government building and army corps headquarters are among those burnt in short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down as to the people of these cities all people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the sarikamis direction for road building and were slaughtered the remaining people were subject to cruelties and murder by armenians following the withdrawal of russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts the few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than those of the spanish inquisition are in poverty more dead than alive horrified some driven insane about in erzincan and in erzurum the people are hungry and in poverty for whatever they had has been taken away from them their lands left uncultivated the people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in stores left over from the russians the villages round erzincan and erzurum are in the worst condition some villages on the road have been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely massacred let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions a long list a long list and still anxiously awaiting serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination ohanus appressian in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul sahak

anything not mentioning peace or agreement i also know several tens of jokes about arabs palestinians but i do not post them to usenet anyway not to this newsgroup since i don t think i will achieve any target but making other parts furious and this is not my target if this is your target well that tells a lot about you can nick steel provide documentation for this alleged incident did you really think he is talking about something realistic harry you must be kidding this is not a single incident now this has become a daily life practice in gazza if you mean the killing of children by armed soldiers yeah well sometimes when cowards put their children and wives in the front line so their enemy cannot do anything well maybe in those cases you have no better thing to do to save your life than shooting and if parents want their children alive i think it would be better that before they get out to throw stones molotov botlles or when they come to kill soliders to keep their children in the houses if you are objecting the number of occupying israeli soldiers terrorists or the way they do it then look in the dictionary at the word terrorism it says nu the use of threats of violence and violence esp for political purposes it sounds more like your guys i caan assure you that they do worse than that just as yeah well i guess you were in there and you know it all example children were killed this month of ramadhan two of them by military vehicules an other similar incident by vehicule was the one of feb ramadhan where thee military truck on purpose hit a passenger where from do you know that it was on purpose personally i didn t hear about this case although i don t deny it but how can anybody besides the person itself can say it was on purpose car where the victims were a year girl safa sail bisharat and saamud riyad a weeks old babygirl the oldd raajij rouhy yeah sure the truck driver looked in the car with his zionist equipment of detecting palestinian children and then he thought to himself hey there is a year and weeks girls in the car why won t i make an accident and kill the enemy maximum i will die too in the crash but what do i care hakim actually if can remember correctly was it not reported and even on camera some time during the israeli invasion of lebanon or when the itifada began that cnn caught regular uniformed israeli soldiers breaking the arms of some arab youngsters in a very professional and brutal manner someone please give full details if they can remember this is one of the few well it was about years ago in the intifada the fact that you can t remember the time prooves how much do you care about it i do not think that what the soliders did was correct but i will not agree that they were breaking their arms i saw that film and unlike in the usa it was broadcasted entirely not long ago in a talk show and at the end the arm broken guys got up and walked and used their arms very good they guy who did it was interviewed and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take his orders and spitted in his face what ammount of truth exist in this statement i cannot tell you because i wasn t there but the guy who did it was in prison if it makes you any good occassions on which such a scene has been transmitted to the west and in the usa it caused uproar and was one of the factors that has significantly changed the preception of the israeli army s role in the mid east no it didn t the israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle east it is still the only human army as much as an army can be human to any american who will claim the opposite i can only remember the cnn broadcasting of the american solider who beat a somalian boy it was very cruel to see but i won t say because of this that the american army is cruel so there is proof for you it is obvious that is a systematic policy of the israelis which must be occurring on a massive scale behind the scenes some kind of proof obvious where from if you say it is behind the scenes how do you know about it nadeem i just wanted to show how much garbadge one can say without knowing anything about what he says

most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i m merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for some most its citizens basically revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate ok let me re phrase the question i have repeatedly asked you if the israelis have less human rights than the palestinians well if you just waited for more lines you would have read my statement secondly surely israeli have human rights but and if so why because they belong to the human race or do you disagree on that too from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred that you thought so together with the above statement i then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of israel re your statement of occupation i d like you to define the term so i don t have to repeat this drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights i m sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase it i donot know about you but it makes full sense to me israelis are being killed because israel is occupying let israel withdraw and israeli blood will be saved it isnot the palestineans who undermined the right of life of israelis but it is israel which occupied and exposed the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of more generally the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada and i had previously posted a long article about this issue whom i finished by an open question suppose the intifada stops what is the motive for israel to withdraw donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit everybody in the world looks and hopes for peace so why isnot there any hope of peace is necessary but not sufficient motive if a state can deprive all it s citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant oh ok so how about the human rights of the syrians iraqis and others does the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurds in iraq and turkey how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched the russians in the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you as for the arabian countries their problems are an arabian concern the arabian people can deal with it themselves if the west doesnot intervene as for serbs i donot think that those fucked up rapists excuse my language but it really hurts as much if i was in bosnia itself arenot humans those surely came from outer space or something no human can allow himself to see such attrocities than to participate in and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won t repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i m eagerly awaiting your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph no i m agreeing that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both parties if that s what you refer to as the israeli solution then so be it ok joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out davar september courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that s the english translations if you have other information i d be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i m not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but it s fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with men like joseph weitz oh have you met with them personally to read their diaries fascinating what do you do for a living we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by any system can be used to solve the conflict but not any system would resolve it justly an unjust solution would be a non solution per definition no my definition is the same as yours but one has to look into the world politics in politics a solution doesnot imply just solution you said the following for all a it holds that a have property b there exists an a such that property b does not hold thus either or both statements must be false guess where that takes your logic to never never land you are proving yourself as a first you understood what i meant but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic too bad for you the master of wisdom i was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point this out before you started using your statements to prove a point or so am i then to assume you are not logical it seems that it was problem in the definition of solution i think a solution must be just because otherwise it would never be lasting however when politicians say a solution they donot mean a just solution but just a solution the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in if you were a zionists if you believe in zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism if you are not zionist why are you bothered then you should join me in condemning these racist zionist codes and acts any quote can be misused especially when used to stereotype all individuals by a statement of an individual if you use the same methods that you credit zionists with then where does that place you oh by the way i d advice you not to assume anything about my loyalties i will and am condemning acts i find vile and inhuman but i ll try as long as i can not to assume those acts are by a whole people by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel the leaders of israel political and or religious or the jews in general if you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible instead how would you feel if we started condemning you personally based

man who said this who will here be called danny his full name is known to the editors served in the cherry after his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy his pal who will here be called dudu was also serving in the cherry and is now about to depart for a round the world tour they both look no different from average israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service but in their souls one can notice something completely different it was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them and they think that to most of their fellows from the cherry it woundn t be easy either yet after they began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking the following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team in which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry we called such soldiers h i hit by the intifada under my command was a

mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind i told her how i shot an arab and how exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it she began to laugh hysterically i wanted her to cry

the arab with the molotov cocktail and the third at his chum it hit him straight in his ass we both felt that we d pulled off something next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look i reached the spot first and then that arab blood gushing forth from his body spits at me i yelled shut up and he dared talk back to me in hebrew so i just laughed straight in his face i am usually laughing when i stare at something convulsing right before my eyes then i told him all right wait a moment i left him in order to take a look at another wounded arab i asked a soldier if that arab could be saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that i keep telling all this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight into my face this infuriated me i got very angry because i felt i was becoming mad so i stopped eating seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over her head only then she stopped laughing at first she didn t know what to say but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently i went with a friend to practice shooting on a field a gull appeared right in the middle of the field my friend shot it at once then we noticed four deer standing high up on the sigh four deer in tel aviv well this is probably as accurate as the rest of this fantasy hill above us my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock we shot down two deer more and went to take a look when we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother we carefully inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit we were just delighted by that sight we had hit em so good then we decided to kill the young deer too so as spare it further suffering i approached took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in but my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us this made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like beasts of prey we couldn t explain what had happened to us we were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we felt the whole day very badly we always go back to places we carried out assignments in this is why we can see them when you see a guy you disabled may be for the rest of his life you feel you got power you feel godlike of sorts both danny and dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting dudu is not willing to work in any security linked occupation danny feels the exact opposite why shouldn t i take advantage of the skills i have mastered so well why shouldn t i earn for each chopped head i would deliver while being a mercenary in south africa this kind of job suits me perfectly i have no human

remember of the turkish invasion of the greek island of cypress while the world simply watched and the turkish karabag is next as for cyprus in turkiye stepped into cyprus to preserve the lives of the turkish population there this is nothing but a simple historical fact unfortunately the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority the problems in cyprus have their origin in decades of oppression of the turkish population by the greek cypriot officials and their violation of the co founder status of the turks set out in the constitution the coup d etat engineered by greece in to execute a final solution to the turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked turkiye s intervention turkiye intervened reluctantly and only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues consulting with britain and greece as the other two signatories to the treaty to protect the integrity of cyprus there simply was not any expansionist motivation in the turkish action at all this is in dramatic contrast to the greek motivation which was openly expansionist stated as enosis union with greece since the creation of independent cyprus in the turkish population although smaller legally had status as the co founder of the republic with the greek population the greek cypriots with the support of enosis minded greeks in the mainland have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the island as a greek island with a minority population of turks the turks of cyprus are not a minority in a greek republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their autonomy in a separate republic turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo she would rather not be involved with the island but given the dismal record of brutal greek oppression of the turkish population in cyprus she simply cannot leave the fate of the island s turks in the hands of the greeks until the turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob turkish cypriots of their rights liberties and their very lives source cyprus the tale of an island a h rizvi p throughout cyprus following the greek cypriot premeditated onslaught of december the turkish sectors all over cyprus were completely besieged by greeks all telephonic telegraphic and postal communications between these sectors were cut off and the turkish cypriot community s contact with each other and with the outside world was thus prevented turkish quarter of nicosia and suburbs greek cypriot armed elements broke into hundreds of turkish homes and fired at the unarmed occupants with automatic weapons killing at random many turks including women children and elderly persons turks were killed and wounded they also carried away as hostages more than turks including women and children whom they forced to walk bare footed and in night dresses across rough fields and river beds throughout cyprus the greek cypriot administration deprived turkish cypriots including ministers mps and turkish members of the public services of the republic of their right to freedom of movement in his report no s of december to the security council the un secretary general stated in this respect the following restrictions on the free movement of civilians have been one of the major features of the situation in cyprus since the early stages of the disturbances these restrictions have inflicted considerable hardship on the population especially the turkish cypriot community and have kept tension high throughout cyprus supply of petrol was completely denied to the turkish sections makarios

numbers of massacred men children and women are greatly minimized as per request of hasan from the revolt by menachem begin dell publishing ny pp apart from the military aspect there is a moral aspect to the story of dir yassin at that village whose name was publicized throughout the world both sides suffered heavy casualties we had four killed and nearly forty wounded the number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers the arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy the fighting was thus very severe yet the hostile propaganda disseminated throughout the world deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of dir yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began one of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in arabic all women children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill by giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle a substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt a few did not leave their stone houses perhaps because of the confusion the fire of the enemy was murderous to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony our men were compelled to fight for every house to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades and the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties the education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war we never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us in accordance with the accepted custom of war to apply reprisals i am convinced too that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the dir yassin battle but those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of dir yassin would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy in connection with the capture of dir yassin the jewish agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to abdullah whom mr ben gurion at a moment of great political emotion called the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country the wise ruler whose mercenary forces demolished gush etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey replied with feudal superciliousness he rejected the apology and replied that the jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of dissidents throughout the arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about jewish attrocities the enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name in the result it helped us panic overwhelmed the arabs of eretz israel kolonia village which had previously repulsed every attack of the haganah was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting beit iksa was also evacuated these two places overlooked the main road and their fall together with the capture of kastel by the haganah made it possible to keep open the road to jerusalem in the rest of the country too the arabs began to flee in terror even before they clashed with jewish forces not what happened at dir yassin but what was invented about dir yassin helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield the legend of dir yassin helped us in particular in the saving of tiberias and the conquest of haifa a footnote from the revolt pp to counteract the loss of dir yassin a village of strategic importance arab headquarters at ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story alleging a massacre by irgun troops of women and children in the village certain jewish officials fearing the irgun men as political rivals seized upon this arab gruel propaganda to smear the irgun an eminent rabbi was induced to reprimand the irgun before he had time to sift the truth out of evil however good came this arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst arabs and arab troops who were seized with panic at the mention of irgun soldiers the legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of israel the dir yassin massacre lie is still propagated by jew haters all over the world in reference to denunciation of dir yassin by fellow jews,talk.politics.mideast

any concentration labor camp in turkey around or later for cypriot greeks or any greeks rather than talking nonsense like above i will be glad to read what they got how can you be in a position to know about any kind of concentration camps akgun living through those days at the age of and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and position in turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time forget about internal news agencies i haven t heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with greek cypriot prisoners in turkey however i heard adana pow camp it was not secret and well recognized pow camp as for all the registered prisoners to the red cross having returned to their homes this is your version of the story there are cases in which prisoners who were registered some of them even sent messages to their relatives were not released these are undeniable facts i see they vanished in turkish labor camps turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing them is that it what do you think happened to them i thought that mia s are only the subject of rambo and chuck noris movies seems that i am wrong as for their treatment being according to what convention okay we believe you you don t need to belive me turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history it has been a respected and continuous member of un since the inception of un no body ever questioned the un membership of turkey because of what had happened in a and after only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by usa to satisfy the internal greek loby i know what you would say next let me answer it before wasting anytime yes un had a few condemning resolutions against turkey because of handling the cyprus problem especially after the coup well us and israel had a few too what can i say i am sure during athens junta duruing greeks had their own share too closed matter today between turkish cypriots turks greeks greek cypriots there is no more any official demand from greek cypriots about any missing greek cypriots where have you heard that there is no official demand regarding the missing persons have you looked at the latest un agenda for cyprus talks mediated by gali there was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties was there i heard many times from denktas interviews by turkish and international press he keeps saying that this was no longer an issue for peace talks also you don t want me fish for the greek cypriot politician s words that argic had posted zillion times describing missing peoples as a greek cypriot myth seems that there is a different opinions among greek cypriots as well about missing people in turkish custody your claim that the majority of the missing persons were infact killed in the period between the coup d eta and the invasion days is simply not true all the cases of missing persons i know and i know quite a few are cases of people who were either in the reserve forces and were lost somewhere in the battlefield or were civilians who were taken prisoners in their villages by the turkish army i am not claiming anything i just told you what was given to greek cypriots as an answer by turkish goverment turkish cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between july and the final cease fire in late august this answer seems to satisfy the international community the un and the vasilu goverment since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks also i am not aware of any un condemnation against turkey about any missing greek cypriot are you btw do you mean that nicos sampson had a bloodless coup d eta and nobody got hurt in those events as of the few photos which you refer to there are more than a few there are photos not only of greek cypriot soldiers being rounded up but also others in the prison camp in turkey like i said before there is even a different opinion among greek cypriots for this myth the officers in turkish army who governed the adana pow camp must be hell of clever dudes to cover up their tracks i hope turkish army does t have same type of morons for the security of turkiye however this must a good subject for a movie script one should inform oliver stone about this of course not the justice was served well if and when the bosnian pleas are answered who s going to dare to ask what happens to those masterminds behind the ethnic cleansing idea they are known today as eoka b masterminds were known in to everybody and are doing it openly even giving tv interviews it may take same time as it was for the eoka b case however the justice will be served again akgun comparing the actions of the serbians in bosnian with the actions of turkey in cyprus is not something i would do if i were a turk i thought that the serbians were the savages the inhumane beasts etc etc c akgun michalis syrimis if this is what you

the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc some young men usually aged between to years are members of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians this a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search certainly the people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm s way are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel should totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers your damn right israel insists on some sort of demilitarized or buffer zone its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of arab states and watched as the states did nothing it is not exactly surprizing that israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti israel guerillas in residence i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled good lord brad what in the world goves you the idea that un troops stop anything they are only stationed in a country because that country allows them in it can ask them to leave at any time as nasser did in and somehow with that limitation on the troops powers i don t think that israel is going to be any more comfortable without a genuine commitment to peace from the arab states and concrete not intellectual or political exercises in jargon guarantees by other parties the un is worthless to israel but perhaps useful as a ruse this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate if however you call on israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic groups if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so called security zone before the conclusion of the peace talks such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israel s public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it from israel s perspective concessions gets it nothing except the realization that it has given something up and now can only hope that the other side decides to do likewise words can be taken back by merely doing so to take back tangible items land control of land requires the sort of action you say israel should stay away from israel put up with attacks from arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of lebanon the entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the arab state involved that state promptly ignored the entire matter secure in the knowledge that it could not be held responsible for the acts committed by private groups israel would prepare for the next round of attacks what would israel want to return to those days and don t be so idiotic as to suggest trust for the motivations of present day arab states there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances ah ok what is different about the present situation that tells us that the arab states will not pursue their past antagonistic policies towards israel now don t talk about vague political factors but about those tangible just like that which israel gave up factors that guarantee the responsibility of those states your assessment of difference here is based on a whole lot of assumptions and most states don t feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon basil it has not without the support and active involvement of syria lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one sided and

including the ruling pasok party and a host of political groups both armenian and non armenian joined to voice their solidarity with the armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new armenian political force were voiced here on sunday april during the nd international meeting of solidarity with the armenian people and judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations at least here in greece the armenian cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world the international meeting of solidarity was sponsored by the greek branch of the armenian popular movement a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of armenians who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia asala the organization has branches in various european and middle eastern countries and the united states although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of asala voicing the support of pasok the ruling party in greece to the armenian people was mr charalambidi michalis a member of the central committee of the party and the greek member of the permanent people s tribunal explaining the goals and aspirations of the armenian popular movement was ara sarkisian significant was the address delivered by mr bassam abu salim on behalf of the popular front for the movement s continued support of the armenians armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause pledging that palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to armenian youth who need training for such a struggle later mr abu salim answering a question put to him by this writer affirmed that his organization had always trained armenian members of asala and that this policy will continue the doors of our camps are always open to armenian freedom fighters he affirmed among the prominent greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of prime minister papandreou who himself holds a post in the greek cabinet two members of the cypriot parliament who had journeyed to athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering representatives of the christian democratic party edik center party two wings of the communist party representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations a number of mayors of greek towns and cities two greek members of the european parliament and other members of the greek parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of bulgaria in athens more than significant was the large number of messages received by the organizers including the following palestinian national revolutionary movement fatah popular front for the liberation of palestine general command the central committee of the palestinian national liberation movement fatah the socialist progressive party of lebanon arab socialist labor party the kurdistan democratic union of iraq and numerous other international groups all noted for their radical stand in the israeli palestinian conflict support from arf rm among messages received from armenian groups was the armenian revolutionary federation revolutionary movement the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers the message clearly gave its support to the armenian popular movement pledging that the revolutionary movement will continue to reveal the realities no matter how bitter or tragic they are to expose the anti armenian activities of the leaders of the dashnag bureau the message was taken as an indication of the link loose as it may be that exists between the dissident dashnag group and the armenian popular movement open supporters of asala and armed struggle the armenian popular movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the greek capital known as neos kosmos where there is a large armenian presence the headquarters are located in a two story building which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of armenian youth who prefer to give their first names only when invited

because you do not like them because they really exist why as i said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source given by serdar argic you couldn t reject it in addition the author s preface was written on january but the book was published in here we go again in the book i have both the front page and the author s preface give the same year and january respectively anyone can check it at her his library if not i can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct i really don t care what year it was first published or what i care about is what the book writes about murders tortures et in the given quotes by serdar argic and your denial of these quotes and your groundless accussations etc dd i can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim vd what is new i will post a gif file but i am not going go through the effort to show there is some turkish modified re publication of the book like last time i claim i have a book in my hand published in first publication and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in serdar argic s reference has you couldn t reject it but now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting around let s see how you lie from non existing quotes to re publication first you said there was no such a quote in the given reference you called serdar argic a liar i said to you no mr davidian there exactly existed such a quote i even gave the call number page numbers you could t reject it and now you are lying again and talking about modified re published book without any proof how when where by whom etc by the way how is it possible to re publish the book in if it was first published in your claim i am sure that you have some pretty well suited theories as usual and i am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and mr davidian s lies i also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use which are r and the page numbers to verify the quotes and it is not possible that s text has pages mine has and yours has now are you claiming that there can t be such a reference by saying it is not possible if not what is your point differences in the number of pages mine was published in serdar argic s was in no need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publications etc etc does it give you an idea the issue was not the number of pages the book has or the year first published and you tried to hide the whole point the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed tortured etc by armenians and those quotes given by serdar argic exist it was the issue wasn t it you were not able to object it does it bother you anyway you name all these tortures and murders by armenians as a crap people who think like you are among the main reasons why the world still has so many craps in the any question serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve

yigal arens a research scientist at the university of southern california who is a son of the former israeli defence minister arens told the san francisco examiner he had seen a file the adl kept on

gerard both kept information on thousands of california political activists in the documents a police investigator said he believed the adl paid bullock for many years to provide information and that

file on him in the s presumably because he has criticized israel s treatment of palestinians the adl believes that anyone who is an arab american or speaks politically against israel is at least a closet anti semite arens said the adl has denied any wrongdoing but couldn t comment on the lawsuit because it hasn t reviewed it said a spokesman at the adl s new york headquarters the fbi and local

greenpeace the national association for the advancement of colored people and san francisco public television station kqed some information allegedly came from confidential police and government

of b nai brith with violating their privacy by spying on them for the israeli and south african governments the class action suit filed in san francisco superior court charges the adl and its

to comment on the suit the suit also took aim at two top local adl officials and retired san francicso police officer tom gerard claiming they violated privacy guarantees in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws according to the suit gerard helped the adl obtain access to confidential files in law enforcement and government computers information from these files were passed to the foreign governments the suit charges the whole concept of an organized collection of information based on political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is absolutely repugnant said former rep pete mccloskey who is representing the plaintiffs the adl s information gathering network was revealed publicly last week when the san francisco district attorney s office released documents indicating the group had spied on people and political and ethnic groups for more than years my understanding is that they the adl consider all activity that is in some sense opposed to israel or israeli action to be part of their responsbility to investigate said arens a research scientist at the university of southern california the adl believes that anyone who is arab american or speaks politically against israel is at least a closet anti semite the fbi and the district attorney s office have been investigating the operation for four months the plaintiffs in

dorin s questions even though they were not addressed to me specifically but i feel that i am a bit concerned by the thread since i am a southern lebanese from a village that is often on the receiving end of israel s bombs in the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied lebanese terrritory is not an act of terrorism or murder it is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder this exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth it seems to me dorin that you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation i will try to paint the most accurate picture i can of what the situation really is in south lebanon in article apr unocal com stssdxb st unocal com dorin baru writes is there any israeli a civilian in your opinion now i do not condone myself bombing villages any kind of villages but you claim these are villages with civilians and iraelis claim they are camps filled with terrorists you claim that israelis shell the villages with the hope of finding a terrorist or so if they kill one fine if not too bad civilians die right i am not so sure i am i was back in my home village this last summer for your information we are people not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business some work in the fields some own small shops others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee is that so hard to imagine it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc some young men usually aged between to years are members of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist hideout where an year old girl just happened to be we are now accustomed to israeli tactics and we figure that this is the israeli way of telling us that if you re gonna hurt our soldiers you re gonna pay the price we accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers israel s retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw the people of south lebanon are occupied or shelled by israel on a regular basis we do not want to be occupied if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land we are not asking for the establishment of a lebanese occupied zone in northern israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by israel so the best policy seems to be the removal of israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so called security zone before the conclusion of the peace talks such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israel s public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon if you ask me those questions i will have no problem answering not with a question as you did no nobody is qualified candidate for murder nothing justifies murder i agree only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing cannot be qualified as murder no matter

nra ila nra official journal dear sir by now we are used to the new england journal of medicine s publication of small scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data followed by announcements of momentus scientific findings these are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings generally while they at least present a few interesting data however meaningless the studies misinterpret statistics and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists the latest effort handgun regulations crime assaults and homicide a tale of two cities by j h sloan et al with the accompanying editorial firearms injuries a call for science by two employees of the centers for disease control november however is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that i feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings in no particular order the authors misleadingly cite wright et al ref to support the statement that some have argued that restricting access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate of homicide wright et al in fact studied and rejected that contention the authors pretended that vancouver and seattle are very similar cities with similar economic circumstances histories demographic characteristics and the like in fact the cities are very different with very different demographic characteristics which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in seattle both cities are over three forths non hispanic white and the non hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be the same in seattle and vancouver it is the different back grounds problems circumstances and behaviors of the various ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide the authors pretend they are evaluating canada s gun law compared to washington state s but they do not examine at all the situation in vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect in as it happens in the three years prior to that vancouver averaged homicides per year one eighth involving handguns ref and in the seven years of the nejm article there were homicides per year one eigth involving handguns surely even the medical profession recognizes that one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding that a change made a difference would a physician conclude that a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day for seven years because his cholesterol level was without at least seeing if it was before he started the regimen the authors pick two medium sized cities to evaluate a national gun law nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily selected sample seattle appears to have been selected because it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific reason would physicians call something a scientific study which involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar control had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen opposite scientific conclusions would follow vancouver s homicide rate exceeds that of such wild west cities in texas as el paso corpus christi austen and in colorado colorado springs ref the authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or handguns are far more commonly owned in seattle than in vancouver they use two surrogate approaches in pretending to study the availability of firearms handguns the first is an apples and oranges effort to compare the number of carry permits in seattle to the number of registered handguns in vancouver but the number clearly understates the number of handguns in seattle and counts primarily protective handgun owners the second however tells nothing about the number of handguns in vancouver and counts non protective handguns for the most part where is it difficult to obtain handguns legally for protection registration figures are meaningless there are registered handguns in new york city new york daily news sept comparing the two that method suggests about handguns per population in new york city compared to in vancouver meaning vancouver has a greater prevalence of weapons than new york city the second method of measuring gun density is cook s gun prevalence index a previously validated measure of intercity differences but the validation was by cook of his own theory ref normally second opinions are sought from a different doctor more significantly the cook index is based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement in suicide and homicide so the authors are basically taking a measure of misuse unsurprisingly gun misuse in homicide in seattle in vancouver is related to gun misuse in homicide plus suicide divided by two in seattle in vancouver the authors are not measuring the relative avail ability of firearms or of handguns in seattle and vancouver the authors misstate the laws of both washington and canada they neglect to mention the significant fact that washington has a waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun and that provisions exist in canadian law for owning and carrying handguns for personal protection the authors also make it appear that it is more difficult to get a handgun legally in canada than is actually the case the authors ignore all other factors which might explain the differences in crime rate beyond some vague mention of the penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of clearence for one particular offense homicide involving a firearm there is no measure of the differences in the number of law enforcement officers their aggressiveness in making arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions arrest rates for other offenses conviction rates actual sentences imposed for gun related crimes violent crimes without guns or gun law violations or incarceration rates whereas social scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences the authors of the nejm tale of two cities fail even to mention most factors related to crime control the authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective means for protection unless the criminal is killed such is not the case criminologists ref have found that almost americans annually use handguns for protection from criminals and that using a gun for protection reduces the liklihood that a crime rape robbery assault will be completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury to the victim it is interesting nonetheless that the authors reported the same number four of civilian justifiable homicides without firearms in each city but that less restrictive seattle accounted for of the reported civilian justifiable homicides involving firearms the centers for disease control which funded the study editorially praised the paper ref saying it applied scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb advocates of stricter regulation of firearms particularly handguns there is nothing in the paper which could possibly be mistaken for scientific methods by a sociologists or criminologists the vancouver seattle study is the equivolent of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding two ordinary looking middle class white males one aged and the other and without first taking their vital signs administering the experimental drug to the year old while giving the year old a placebo then taking their blood pressure and on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure announcing in a special article a new medical breakthrough it would be nice to think that such a study would neither be funded by the cdc or printed by the nejm since the longstanding anti gun biases of the nejm and the cdc make them willing to present shoddy research as scientific breakthroughs in special articles and editorials relating to firearms we are obligated to correct the record by notifying the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight over the activities of the centers for disease control about the distortions contained in handgun regulations crime assaults and homicides a tale of two cities and firearm injuries a call for science clearly all scientific standards go by the wayside

convention chicago mercy ja houk vn firearm injuries a call for science nejm guns and sputter by james d wright from july issue of reason free minds free markets someone once wrote statistics are like a bikini what they real is suggestive but what they conceal is vital the problem is demonstrated by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide funded by the federal government and published last year in the new england journal of medicine the study compared homicide rates in seattle and vancouver and suggested that a handgun ban may reduce the rate of homicide in a community the nine medical doctors who published handgun regulations crime assaults and homicide essentially reasoned in three steps despite many historical social and demographic similarities vancouver has a markedly lower homicide rate because its stricter gun regulations make guns less available the second step in their reasoning seems indisputable the overall homicide rate in seattle for the period was per popuation compared with in vancouver homicide is definitely more common in seattle the question then becomes why the authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case to support the notion as claimed in the third step of their reasoning that vancouver s handgun regulations are much more stringent but their evidence on the difference in gun availabilty is indirect and unpersuasive indeed they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point does not exist they offer two fragments of inferential data in support of the claim that guns are more available in seattle but for all anybody knows as a matter of empirical fact the opposite could be true we are therefore being asked at the conclusion of the study to believe that a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established indeed the situation is even more troublesome the first of the two indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed weapons permits issued in seattle and the number of restricted weapons permits issued in vancouver differences between the two cities in the permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable the second bit of evidence is cook s gun prevalence index which stands at percent for seattle but only percent for vancouver cook s index however does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in various cities it measures gun misuse it is an average of the percentage of homicides and suicides involving firearms in the present case the index shows only that in homicides and suicides firearms are more likely to be used in seatte than in vancouver to take cook s index as a measure of general firearms availability it must be assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides is directly related to their relative availability in the general population but this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove to assume what one is seeking to prove then to prove it on the basis of that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything even if we were to grant on the basis of no compelling evidence that guns are less common in vancouver we might still question what causes what the authors attribute seattle s higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun ownership but it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns in other words that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership not vice versa in fact it was once commonly argued that great britain s low rate of violent crime was a function of that nation s strict gun laws and the consequent low rate of gun ownership until british researcher colin greenwood found that great britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted to invoke an ancient methodological saw correlation is not cause nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data on gun ownership the authors say seattle and vancouver are similar in many ways implying that they differ mainly in gun availability gun law stringency and crime rates this is an evident attempt to establish the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis that all else is equal among things being compared clearly the two cities are similar in some ways but a closer look reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime or homicide rates the cities are closely matched in what percentage of their population is white percent and percent but seattle is about percent black while vancouver is less than percent vancouver s minority population is overwhelmingly asian so although the authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half dozen readily available demographic indicators they have not shown that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out in fact the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is particularly relevant in light of the study s breakdown of homicide rates according to the race of the victim for the white majority the homicide rates are nearly identical per in seattle in vancouver the differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities for blacks the observed difference in homicide rate is to and for hispanics to methodoligical complexities render the asian comparison problematic but it too is higher in seattle than in vancouver racial minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in seattle than in vancouver the white majority is equally likely to be slain in either city since the nearly initial difference in homicide reates between the cities is due exclusively to or differences between minority groups it is fair to ask why postulated difference in gun availability or gun law strigency would matter so dramatically to minorities but not matter at all to whites can differential gun availability explain why blacks and hispanics but not whites are so much more likely to be killed in seattle than in vancouver studies in the united states incidentally do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership or are other explanations more plausible could the disparity between canadian and american rates of poverty among racial minorities have anything to do with it what are the relative rates of drug or alcohol abuse of homelessness among each cty s minority population the city of seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the mississippi unemployment among young central city nonwhite men in the united states usually exceeds percent what is the comparable canadian percentage the crucial point is that canada and the united states differ in many ways as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries absent more detailed analysis nearly any of these many ways might explain part or all of the difference in homicide rates in gross comparisons such as those between seattle and vancouver all else is not equal the authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide result in a complex picture they do not acknowledge that the ensuing complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument they also acknowledge that socio economic status is probably an important confounding factor in our comparison remarking further that blacks in vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in than the rest of vancouver s population given the evidence presented in the article it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between seattle and vancouver results from greater proverty among seattle s racial minorities but the authors pay no further attention to this possibility since detailed information about household incomes according to race is not available for vancouver the largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple example if one were to take all u s couties and compare them in terms of pervalence of gun ownership and crime or homicide rates one would find an astonishing pattern counties with more guns have less crime would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce crime or would one insist that other variables also be taken into account in this example the hidden variable is city size guns are more common in small towns and rural areas whereas crime is a big city problem if researchers failed to anticipate this variable or lacked the appropriate data to examine its possible consequences they coud be very seriously misled in the study at hand the authors matched two cities for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables and their results are impossible to interpret in the editorial firearm injuries a call for science accompanying the study two officials from the centers for disease control lauded the authors for applying scientific methods to a problem of grave public heath significance but in attempting to draw causal conclusions from nonexperimental research the essence of scientific method is to anticipate plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them out absent such effort the results may well seem scientific but are little more than polemics masquerading as serious research that this study is but one of a number

offence mr parsli i have to take exception at this there are verifiable previous examples of levels of u s governments abusing gun control restrictions i don t think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future after so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove or you should get a new goverment you do have elections i d love to but as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents there s not a lot i can do it s silly to suggest that if there s anything we can t trust the government to do and therefore the government should be allowed to do it then we should change governments down that road lies total government power i ve never been a fan of totalitarianism guns n criminals most weapons used by criminals today are stolen this is very likely known criminals can not buy weapons that s one of the points of gun control and because gun control are strict in whole scandinavia and most of europe we dont have any problem with smuggled guns the north american continent is not europe no matter how many people would like it to be drugs are very illegal and they re here for years canada has crowed about its gun control if it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent then canada should have always had comparable rates to the u s yet they still don t unless you can tell me why the canadian border is so much more magical than the mexican border which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled then i really can t accept that argument mixing weapons and things that can be use as one what i meant was that cars can kill but they are not guns no there are approximately deaths due to guns in the u s two thirds of which are suicides unfortunately i don t have suicide rates for norway however this makes the per gun death rate about half the per car death rate the issue i hope i think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem guns are not a problem but the way they are used is and what are they for i think this discusion is interesting when you think of ex jugoslavia they should all have weapons it s their rigth to have them and if they use them to kill other innocent people the problem is humans not guns the problem s been humans since before we had stone axes the fct of the matter is simply this if nobody ever assaulted anybody whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent yet weapons are built i d suggest then that the murderous impulse in humanity pre dates weapons anyway the bosnians et al have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years taking away their guns even if we could would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality if of all murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem it s the axer an example don t flame me just because not exactly are killed by guns in the u s approximately of murders are commited with firearms with handguns with non handguns the reason i say that guns per se are not the problem is that our non gun rate exceeds most of europe s countries entire violent crime rate i don t really think we ve got more knives or fists in any case i think examples of gun control applied to the u s have been abkect failures just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition until you deal with why people are doing what they are doing you won t solve your problem and if the problem is violent crime you shouldn t concentrate on the tools instead the vast majority of guns is never ever misused on the order of over the entire lifetime of the gun this says to me that you can t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse think about the situation in los angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves is this a good situation the situation is not good in that people fear for their lives but recall the scenes of the store owners during the last riots protecting their shops with guns would it have been better they too lost their livelihoods is it the rigth way to deal with the problem the problem of poverty and rage in los angeles no it isn t however if that problem becomes a violent action then yes it can be appropriate whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won t make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it you have to examine which problem you re referring to if you re discussing someone violently assaulting you then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop hopefully simply letting them know you re prepared to shoot them would be enough as it was with the above mentioned store owners if everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals and their neighbor who have guns what do you think will happen i mean if everybody had a gun in usa of households have some form of firearm usually a long gun that accounts for a level of access for at least million americans firearm ownership is most likely among educated well off whites the group least likely to be involved in violent crime you may take that

lance colostate edu organization colorado state university fort collins co lines posted by cathy smith for l neil smith letter to a liberal colleague author s note adrian name changed to protect the guilty and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous new york publishing house dear adrian i m way behind schedule on my current book again so this reply to your note criticizing the recent magazine interview i gave and generally attacking gun ownership will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you re free to believe or not i can back with evidence and logic i ve neither time nor energy to present now i ve written fully on this topic before and will again in the future when i do i ll make sure you get copies there are many arguments i might make from the futility and danger of delegating self defense to the police see don kates in the jan wall street journal to the real effect of prohibition shifting consumers from newly outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed off shotguns or homemade bombs but i ll limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note first the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility second publication of some latter day scientific study doesn t alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists i discussed in my interview annoying you so much in the process were lying third the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility fourth as often happens with these things the study doesn t support the gun prohibitionists original numerical contentions anyway but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies omissions and distortions fifth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility sixth the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions carl bakal author of no right to keep and bear arms even confessed to it publicly makes the value of this present study dubious to say the least seventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility eighth given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction you should be better aware than most people how progress in designing studies to prove whatever you want outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data a case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist or years to create studies proving that pornography causes crime more naive and probably more honest efforts in the s and s clearly indicate the contrary ninth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility tenth another reason to doubt all such studies is that human behavior as the austrian school of economics demonstrates is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified the attempt to do so and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo information is wrecking our civilization eleventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility twelfth the study is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right sometimes with ancillary social benefits if anything perhaps suicide intervention should be a criminal offense thirteenth and finally the national rifle association officials quoted in the article whatever their shortcomings and they are many are correct in this instance the study is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility and because of that adrian even if the study were valid it wouldn t deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however whenever and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody s permission in this i m ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun while they still can before the gun control act most of the shooting fraternity viewed handguns incorrectly as it turned out as inaccurate ineffective toys there probably weren t six million of them in the whole country now thanks to kennedy metzenbaum the bradys and their ilk america s greatest sporting goods sales team we probably manufacture at least that many every year the fascinating datum is that handgun control et al are perfectly aware of this so i guess you ll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are look gun making isn t an arcane or difficult art and by the way it s easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic the fact that i can still obtain my own weapon of preference the self loading pistol is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further even if it were difficult there are already a quarter billion firearms in america with an estimated half life of years possibly more for stainless steel guns are gonna be around a long time adrian whether you like it or not as for me to paraphrase elmer keith regardless of what the law provides or any court decides i m always going to be armed and i will always work to see that others are as well the bad news is that there are thousands more perhaps even hundreds of thousands where i come from we can t be stopped by passing laws we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and given both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics and semiautomatics perhaps more efficiently so what s the point l neil smith author the probability

than with a gun but how the hell are you going to manage that you still haven t offered i ve been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now even contributed a few comments but this stuff i d rather face a knife than a gun has got to come from ignorance i used to think pretty much the same thing then i got educated people do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be or how quickly you can be killed with one most people don t understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick within a minute or so death the death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other many people not realizing how deadly knives are try their luck and thus more get injured by knives a gun is deadly only in a single direction and it s only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon a contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area to feet in diameter most people have never seen knife wounds aside from slicing a finger by accident from feet or so a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill from inside feet or so a knife is a match for a drawn gun a knife is utterly silent it never jams and never runs out of ammunition it is limited only by the speed dexterity skill and ability of it s wielder criminals in general are young fast and strong it s interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices i ve talked to several well trained martial artists they have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut hopefully not as bad as the attacker practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife say a popsicle stick or tooth brush criminals practice their knife attacks in prison if you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat or in the case of an experienced attacker parts of your body falling off onto the ground a year old man with arthritis can close that yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds dennis tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two i ve seen people close that distance and strike in second i m old over weight and slow i can do it in seconds i ve seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe how about a single stab wound to the chest with a table fork in this case the attacker used the handle not the pointed end add to this the fact that hand gun stopping power is largely a myth except in the case of a central nervous system shot or a round that destroys the skeletal structure it takes anywhere from to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to take effect this is true of even heart shots there is the case of the police woman in l a the first recorded survivor of a shot to the heart that lady not only killed her attacker but chased him down to do it all four of her shots fired after she had been shot struck the perp atta girl the bullet entered her on a downward angle went through the apex of her heart down through the diaphragm clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen it then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole she died about six times on the operating table but was out of the hospital in days and was back on full duty in eight months she was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest she was on her way home so happened to have her gun no she doesn t think civilians should have the same rights sigh the moral of the story is that even if you do manage to shoot a knife attacker you d better be planning on doing some dodging a good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis people can often walk a little on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons the target is as large as the traditional center of mass and is more reliable to stop somebody with a contact weapon assuming a caliber powerful enough to do the job hot s on up will usually do this remember folks the idea isn t to take em with you but for you to live and them to fail whatever the consequences for them this the reason killing them isn t our goal or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive i don t want to face a violent attack of any sort knowing what i now know i can t rightly say i d rather face a knife than an gun it would have to depend on the attacker and if i could pick and choose i wouldn t be there this is really the bottom line criminals do not fear the law criminals do not fear the weapon they fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes

one firearm ok a near majority actually own firearms but i will still claim that the vast majority never needs to use them or even threaten anyone with them to self defense incidents a year doesn t count with you what do they do right or are they just lucky maybe they re just unlucky if a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in boston chances are almost certain that she won t be counted as one of those self defenders because our local constabulary didn t consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the gun owner column in either case this means the average threat level in this country is rather low ironic words for somebody who lives in florida the average threat level in florida has been reduced by a liberal ccw policy it s well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because they are less likely to be carrying than your natives come on up to boston or nyc or washington dc and see how much diddlysquat the average threat level in the country means to a resident there i think you have weapons on the brain i never said that these alternative means of self protection involved any hardware why are good neighborhoods good it isn t because every person is armed to the teeth it is because of attitude and cooperation in the good neighborhoods the residents make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when strangers are lurking around good neighborhoods form groups like crime watch to increase this effect and the relative effectiveness of the police when hostiles are arrested the good neighbors step up and say that s the one officer he was robbing mr jones house sometimes this works sometimes it just lands your good neighbors on the dance card for the next wave of drive bys someone here once told a story about la gangs moving into phoenix i ve misplaced the original text but the story started with one resident calling the cops on a gang member sure enough a few nights later there was a drive by performed at the resident s house except that this time unlike in la the entire street came out and returned fire putting an end to the car s occupants the gang packed up and left of course in la or in a place like florida after the hurricane your first problem is to find an officer to step up to and tell anything in short the alternative to firepower is gangs or at least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative replace lead with flesh the flesh makes a better conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a block party look nobody is arguing this i have a fire extinguisher at home that doesn t mean i can be careless about tossing my burnt matches on the carpet i live carefully monitor the woodstove get my flue cleaned twice a year and test my smoke alarms annually but if despite all this a fire does start it s too late for any of these things except the extinguisher but legality and legitimacy also matter if a government s charter makes a rule which the government then violates it is violated the basis for its existance enforcement of its will becomes a matter solely of force of arms oliver north the man is positively worshiped in many all american conservative quarters he and big ron set up a secret government and did all sorts of severely illegal deeds the kind of stuff you and i would be doing twenty to life for yet he walks free this bs happens all the time in fact it happens so much that no one really cares anymore legitimacy is a non issue legality is a non issue so long as we get t bones and our mtv who gives a rats ass you seem to be agreeing with your opponent you can t trust your government to protect you from abusers and violators white collar blue collar epauletted or tank shirted ultimately no one has the power to enforce your rights but you unless you ve given up that power no i claimed that no one is interested in the statistical aspects of the argument pure emotion like the abortion

that there aren t any you seem content to underestimate the electorate i m willing to try to raise their consciousness argue away you can t win i think we can hci was founded in what in the mid s they ran a one million strong campaign for two years before reaching this goal my understanding is that they reached it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues paying members i can t speak authoritatively on this maybe somebody else has details then they started running a two million strong campaign for a while but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership in just after the commencement of the dodd hearings the starting point of the modern gun control movement the nra had a mere members by barely after the first murmurs of future registration it had about a million today it has over three million members making it the third largest membership organization in the country next to aarp and aaa and its membership is growing faster than at any previous time historical figures from kukla s gun control pp and as you say many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused

uicvm uic edu writes deleted and as far as fully automatic weapons you can be a lot better armed if you want to hit what you aim at what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of proportion in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city vs gang members of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time of course they don t and that s the point i was trying to make every day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in the majority that i see are still carrying revolvers not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you re a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat i mean semi auto handguns you re going to be at a disadvantage even with training i have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were practicing shooting they were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they weren t doing too badly either the university cops here who are are state cops are armed better than the chicago police it seems most state cops are define armed better go shoot a revolver and a semi auto like the colt does one fires faster than the other nope aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable sure it makes the other guys duck for cover but just you trying hitting anything with a thompson in hose mode this is why the military is limiting it s m now to round burst fire simple semi auto would be better but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful a revolver is equally capable as a semi auto in the same caliber a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again a double action revolver almost all of them can be hand cocked first but will fire merely by pulling the trigger a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round a revolver can be carried with the th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion even one handed speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi autos can be faster depending on users a misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so is often lost as you realize hey it s jammed before starting to do anything about clearing it most semi autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some police carry their semi autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged i do not consider this safe however you must trade off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver there are some double action semi autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training some police departments switched to glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers too many were having accidents partly due to the poor training they received not that glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a vcr anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don t know nothing about firearms turn off cops and hunter and pay attention i do not seek here to say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid a cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot gun control is hitting what you aim at if you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don t hit anything good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit i own a mm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver if i haven t hit what i m aiming at in the first shots something is quite seriously wrong somewheres while i might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple revolvers that the police often use well actually some police prefer the much heftier magnum but anyway obplea don t flame me i prefer semi autos for most things but they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve wracking as an abrupt encounter

c zj bff dscomsa desy de hallam zeus desy de writes a state is defined by its ability to create laws ergo when the state is not able to make laws we are not talking about a fully functioning state there are always some areas on which the state is able to make and enforce laws and some on which it is not to add some relevance to the group in which i happen to be reading this the u s government circa could not have created laws such as present federal gun control legislation was it not a state yes because it has always had that power the constitution limits the areas in which the government can exercise power the constitution can be changed however and has been frequently for example during prohibition the government had no power to permit alcohol to be sold although the state had the capacity to change the constitution to enable this the constitutional provisions are merely a matter of form that dictate the manner in which power is exercised no piece of paper can prevent abuse for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidate for opposing world war i a clear breach of the first ammendment the united states clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful arms control measures if there were large groups of powerful warlords who could prevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the power of the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited this is the situation in somalia where the state is unable to govern because the people with the guns think that they have the right to decide the law you have a very confused notion of what a state is a modern state is a governing body in the period you describe there is no lasting instance of a period where there was law without a governing body to enforce that law of course there was no effective law without enforcement but saying that a state is a governing body does not mean that it is the only sort of a governing body unless one plays semantic games like if a state didn t create it it s not really a law the problem is extrapolating from our notions of what a state is which date from the treaty of westphalia to the medieval period where countries were much more analogous to bodies like the eec or the un organisations where individual members had significant powers in their own right and did not derive their power from a central authority the canonical example of non governmental law is probably the law merchant which others can expound upon better than i but it was certainly enforced in non state courts for some time although state courts being subsidized later were able to effectively enter the arbitration business but here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary the rules and regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state was not involved in even today a great deal of law is effectively made in this manner for example the city of london stockmarket which is a non governmental body that can make and enforce rules it does so however within the framework laid down by the government in medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner if you were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw the monarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very short time most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit royal charters such as the universities for example fairs and towns all required authority in order to trade it was customary however for this authority to be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case of misbehavior after magna carta the monarch lost the power to remove privillage without recourse to the courts tony benn recently established through a devious route the power of the parliament to revoke favours without recourse to the courts thus establishing the right to abolish the house of lords for example certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the common law which has a very specific meaning in the uk it is law made by the judiciary through judgements on cases nothing else is common law incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect for example a judgment in common law made in england can effect the interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once in the empire including the us the reverse is also true for example a lot of the decisions surrounding aids cases in the us are of relevance to uk decisions although the statues are different the reasoning that lies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus if a judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law in one jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with no guiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime which they might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal the law should be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions without precedent once a decision is made in the uk though that naturally is superior in uk law phill hallam baker,talk.politics.guns

thomasp ifi uio no writes observations from a naive norwegian yup you said it i admire such honesty guns are made to kill people not to shoot target or to have something more macho than stamps to collect fire an anschutz then come back and talk to us you re letting ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking either that or this is sour grapes because we beat you in the olympic shooting events funny you d think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse it is more easy to kill injure someone with a gun than with a knife or a bat as in baseball precisely that makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry not everybody has the time to train with a gladius you know but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time to extend this a bit further you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have i ve spent a few years practicing with a sword i can take the common person armed with one though self defense isn t the reason i own one my kid sister would have an even chance of beating me gun vs gun with only a month of training that makes firearms much better in our eyes it s not very wise to compare two completely different countries like usa and let s say island on issues like crime and violence excellent point perhaps you aren t so naive after all yes the problem is people committing crimes not the tools beeing used but should be taken into concideration taken into consideration in what respect though quite wrong let s make it a blanket statement for weapons in general this has been taken into consideration we call use of them aggrivated assault assault with a deadly weapon assault with intent to kill attempted murder and a whole host of others and tack on extra prison time we have a very strict gun legislation in norway but until recently it was possible for enyone over years to buy a shotgun shotguns are used mainly for hunting in norway but because it was so easy to accuire one it was the most used gun in crimes in norway i suspect it was about the only weapon available you conquered your land among others a full millenia before we were thought of and shortly thereafter weapons weren t quite so common i suspect that a few world wars made a difference too since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes i m curious though were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime or were they aquired by other means any requirements other than just registering the shotgun and unbelievable the use of guns in crime fell there are now a new law against wearing long knives in public and why should it be allowed come on down to honest erik s used swords here s a slightly used short sword the battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century only with trade in easy financing sorry i couldn t resist you guys still slicing each other with long knives or is this really not a problem what i as an scandinavian have problems to understand is that you americans have a more liberal view on guns and violence than on nudity and sex try showing a bare breast on tv insted of violence and murder i m all for that what gets me is that scandanavians and yes i m only a couple generations off the longship used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing maybe you had a bit more time and a more homogeneous culture to become civilized with yes i know a little american history but is it a civil human right to have an assault gun in your home and or an handgun in your car yes we re too damned violent partially i believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don t identify ourselves as americans first and foremost i m rather proud of my norwegian and danish heritage whereas i suspect you couldn t care less about that welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in ireland back in the time scale and the homogeneous culture are important equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good in america the individual is more important than the masses personal liberties are prized above all this is sadly changing of late but i trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to americans i d hazard a guess that were america less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere one poor effect of this culture we have is that we re looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population my grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in denmark because she spoke low dane whereas others spoke high dane it was shortly after world war ii as i remember that low dane was abolished so there was one common dialect we cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem because we have even more obvious means of identifying an outsider the bad english is not my fault it s probably the keyboard software or the quality of the subtext on tv take heart yours is better than of what gets

deaths as the uk and no the brits don t make up for this by murdering x as many people with baseball bats you just can t compare this way all homicides must be shown per capita not just handguns the availability of them in the usa makes them the preferred murder weapon but ban them and some other weapon will step in as the favorite as a favorite sure as lethal not likely a study of violence in chicago produced this table percentage of reported gun and knife attacks resulting in death weapon deaths as percentage of attacks knives total attacks guns total attacks source firearms and violence in american life it might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns that they would find a way to kill as often with knives if this were so knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used like vancouver would show a higher fatality rate but the nat l commission on the causes and prevention of violence task force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case it appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants the proportion of fatal knife attacks did not increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks in fact the reverse was true what was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury multiple stabs wounds wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest etc most gun homicides did not show this pattern rather more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim source report on firearms and violence then since england usa my ancestors left because of the oppression you must compare england before strict gun laws to england after strict gun laws to be able to draw any meaning at all england has essentially legalized drugs so there are no drug gangs battling for turf etc there if you drop out the drug related killings here the usa would look a whole lot more peaceful there are a lot of factors which make a difference actually i m not fond of making any kind of social parallels between europeans and americans there are more cultural beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities i just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks i don t think we could ever attain the low levels of european violent crime here in the us whether we banned guns or required every law abiding citizen to carry a loaded uzi on the other hand we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar namely the canadians in fact an exhaustive seven year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of vancouver british columbia and seattle washington cities with roughly the same population urban economy geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control in seattle handguns may be purchased legally for self defense after a day waiting period a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon the recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted in vancouver self defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun concealed weapons are not permitted recreational uses of handguns target shooting collecting are regulated by the province purchase of a handgun requires a restricted weapons permit a permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box in short gun control but not unreasonably so both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws convictions for gun related offenses carry similar penalties the researchers studied all cases of robbery assault simple and aggravated burglary and homicides occurring in seattle and vancouver from to in defining the cases they used the same standard the fbi s unified crime report results during the seven year study the annual rate of robbery in seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in vancouver burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates assaults were recorded in seattle versus in vancouver the risk of being a victim of a simple assault in seattle was found to be only slightly higher than vancouver and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher however when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault a clear pattern emerged although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons firearms were far more likely to be used in seattle in fact times as often over the seven year study homicides occurred in seattle per vs homicides in vancouver per after adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in seattle as compared to vancouver was found to be when homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons excluding firearms in seattle was found to be almost identical to that in vancouver virtually all of the increased risk of death in seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms handguns accounted for roughly of homicides involving firearms handguns were times more likely to be used in homicides in seattle than in vancouver the authors of the report also investigated legally justifiable homicides self defense only such homicides occurred during the seven year study of which were committed by police only cases of civilians acting in self defense occurrred in seattle and in vancouver only involved firearms after excluding these cases there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings this is i feel a very fair report one might even make the argument that it is biased against canada as a whole because vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of ottawa calgary and toronto while seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two thirds that of nyc chicago los angeles and houston critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means this report shows differently if the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in vancouver than in seattle however during the study interval vancouver s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in seattle suggesting that few would be assailants switched to homicide by other methods as well ready access to handguns for self defense by law abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report although seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self defense these cases accounted for less than of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period and as was reported seattle apparently didn t enjoy relief from any crime category over vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self defense heavily quoted source handgun regulation crime assaults and homicide

vincent cad gatech edu vincent fox writes in u uicvm uic edu jason kratz u uicvm uic edu writes deleted and as far as fully automatic weapons you can be a lot better armed if you want to hit what you aim at what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of proportion in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city vs gang members of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time of course they don t and that s the point i was trying to make every day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in the majority that i see are still carrying revolvers not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you re a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat i mean semi auto handguns you re going to be at a disadvantage even with training i have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were practicing shooting they were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they weren t doing too badly either the university cops here who are are state cops are armed better than the chicago police it seems most state cops are every city and suburban police officer i ve seen around the twin cities in the last two years has carried a semi auto of some type different brands though i haven t seen any glock s with regard to this discussion we are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t p g and close to the realm of r g but i d like to put my two cents worth in while there s nothing wrong with a revolver especially a large frame s w in magnum my favorite there are valid advantages to semi autos i suggest reading massad ayoob s i know some people can t stand him and think he s full of bull but i think that in general his material is very valid and useful book the semi auto pistol in police work or something like that he defines a number of ways that semi auto s are different and that different is good the main advantage is not in increased firepower but in more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode there is also a certain propriatory nature of each gun that takes some familiarity to learn this may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi autos but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun define armed better go shoot a revolver and a semi auto like the colt does one fires faster than the other nope aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable sure it makes the other guys duck for cover but just you trying hitting anything with a thompson in hose mode this is why the military is limiting it s m now to round burst fire simple semi auto would be better but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful a revolver is equally capable as a semi auto in the same caliber a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again a double action revolver almost all of them can be hand cocked first but will fire merely by pulling the trigger yes but this is best done with a two hand hold with a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action the da semi auto has the same advantages plus is always sa after the first shot a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round i m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point in a da semi auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round an advantage you don t have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round discussing this point now this is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation granted it s very rare but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time a revolver can be carried with the th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion even one handed actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended a revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi autos can be faster depending on users the best speedloader users especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast a problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed this means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always take more time you also don t have the advantage of tactical reloads replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity the partial magazine can still be used if needed later a misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so is often lost as you realize hey it s jammed before starting to do anything about clearing it yes the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it really though in either a revolver or semi auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small you are more likely to get a jam in a semi auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns sigs glocks et al most semi autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some police carry their semi autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged i do not consider this safe however you must trade off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver there are some double action semi autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training all common semi auto s can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems while i put that out as a statement that i believe i should say that this applies to all of the ones i ve looked at for the da semi s it s no different from the revolver situation the guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks they also have a safety because there s no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver plus the advantage of sa followup shots i m not familiar with sa semi autos except for the a i admit that i was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked but after examining the design trying to defeat the safeties gun unloaded of course and shooting it a lot i see no inherent safety problems with it especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer this design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver some police departments switched to glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers too many were having accidents partly due to the poor training they received not that glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a vcr yeah the infamous glock i still can t figure out how it s worse than a revolver for safety if you don t pull the trigger it doesn t go off i imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it in addition if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you d have problems when the hammer wasn t there anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don t know nothing about firearms turn off cops and hunter and pay attention i do not seek here to say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid a cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot i think this is even okay for a riot as long as it s a small one b gun control is hitting what you aim at if you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don t hit anything good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit i own a mm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver if i haven t hit what i m aiming at in the first shots something is quite seriously wrong somewheres while i might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than i have the poor man s beretta taurus and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the springfield oops mm vs arguments are relegated to r g you are right though if you don t hit what you aim at then the shooter gun combination has failed i don t ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder nine scenario you mention to the gun this is a shooter failure whether through lack of discipline or lack of training what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple revolvers that the police often use well actually some police prefer the much heftier magnum but anyway mm s are becoming more popular with crooks too though the does still lead the list and like i said around here semi auto s seem the rule for the street cop don t know about the state patrol however they may still carry the highway patrolman obplea don t flame me i prefer semi autos for most things but they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal vincent please don t take any of this as a flame just my whoops looks more like worth and much of it is imho but do check ayoob s book if everything had gone as

xavier gallagher writes so what does this prove i do not object to property ownership i just think property ownership should be limited to what an individual person family needs i do not need acres to survive i need about acres at most and could get by on less i argue that by having all property tied up and thus cutting people off form the basic level of subsistance that the property owners must bribe the rest of us to respect their ownership rights by providing alternative means of subsistance when we are expected to give these peoperty owners lets call them thieves bribes in order to be able to subsists then we have a sick situation the property owners are then parasites i want people to be able to live happy and prosperous lives property owners cannot maintain a monopoly in the free enterprise system unless they have help from a coercive government when a few land owners get together and try to control all the land without selling land prices will go up at some point it will be to the advantage of the land owner to sell some of his property trying to put a group of people to distribute land fairly would give them monopoly control over the land and would have the consequences you speak of let s keep the land out of the grasp of a monopoly and let it exist in the free market it s already in the hands of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism of land other than government land saved for posterity and the eco system as well as government function the remaining land is owned by a smaller percentage of the people than ever before the game of capitalism is almost won the game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters into our own hands and redistribute it again fairly or else be enslaved in return for a place to live here in central california already fewer than own all the property and of them own of it that s twice what it was twenty years ago rents are so high that you pay of your income for rent if you just have a mcjob all you can afford is one room if that some of minimum wage workers are homeless unless you both have degrees in technical fields and are working in them in the midst of unemployment in high tech jobs you will never own anything but a used car if you choose to have more than one child and everywhere else you could afford there are no jobs the only way to get there is to save and not consume any more than you have to clothing used food poor no movies no entertainment ect for about five to seven years and then if you ve saved if you can get together that much and that s ignoring your kids and working two jobs then you can buy a home in arkansas or missouri outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year that s an exaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other people s houses and find a sturdy hill then you can buy one up there also buy a rowboat missouri s not so bad if you like the sensation of sleeping in a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter they really do put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to start with ether shit kill the rich and redistribute the livable property kill all of them rsw i want people to be able to work and gain a basic subsistance and more is there a workable system for what you suggest i am always looking for improvements on the way we can coexist in this world and will give people happy meaningful lives where each individual can reach their highest potential are you asking for the forced redistribution of land any system i imagine will lead to unfairnes pollution over popullation and land mismanagement if you know of such a system please describe it please be specific since my imagination cannot comprehend such a system specifics that i am interested in does someone get land assigned them when they are born what happens to someone s land when they die can they pass it on to their children can someone sell land can someone leaase their land what governmental restrictions will be put on land use who will administer such a system how much will it cost to administer such a system i know that this is alot to ask and will understand if you do not have the time to answer these questions i think i will be better able to understand what you are proposing if you can answer these quesitons paul schmidt advocates for self government davy crockett chapter president the land is simply granted to people who live on it now extra is kept for the future you get to stay where you are without paying rent land that supports others becomes property of the state farmers are welcome to plant crops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality if you want to grow sourgum because you always did and you aren t doing a good job then we let another farmer grow sorghum and you grow something else when people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the public holdings no one can sell land but they can trade places with anybody no one can lease land the government will locally distribute the use of the land not used for residences residences that are insufficient to the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house and yard according to need and availability the local land council who vow to live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness subject to review by the state and federal land councils it will cost no more than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a deep dark hole to the owners anyone can submit a request for a larger house or land to start a business on depending on a valid business plan and community needs heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public good or as needed heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and maintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in service to the community companies who own many machines are to be divided among the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid operators on a need basis cost of upkeep is charged a guild of heavy machine operators is recognized for safety and training s sake their council is a subcouncil to the community council etc etc etc it isn t so hard to think of a better system than we have all you have to do is realize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct in fact it s a rigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could be already the trick is to realize that the old rich have been making the rules behind your back and that it s time to kick them off the merry go round tax the rich to death they are the ones that converted your s school lunch program into the joke it is today they are the ones who always cut education they are the ones who always raise the rent when you get a raise they are the ones who should be not just dislodged but killed for their abuse i have trouble justifying the death penalty for a poor kid who killed and didn t know why not i have no trouble justifying the death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed their greed have you paid rent most of your life then you have been enslaved percentage wise most of your life we used to be serfs now we are called renters and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own land they don t use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to own it most rents in california are enough to buy the apartment house paynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with i have seen the books i know what my landlord pays and to whom i know what i pay her i am being forced to buy her a building and then i will be let out at the other end with nothing when i had as much right as her to live on this planet and her child will have the money to likewise enslave my child i hope i find out when i am going to die i can make things just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she destroyed mine and maybe i can take a

not a euphemism because if she heard thankfully you got the gender right for i am not a deviant wow another clayton wannabe typical response lack of logic define deviant someone who deviates from the normal ok so far define normal erm umm if you define yourself as normal then it is for you to prove that you are within limits which then brings in the question what are the limits for you we may have to broaden them to other s intolerance normal difficult to prove from what you have posted it must follow that normal to you means someone without compassion and a sense of justice but it does look as if you went to the clayton school of logic doesn t it how disparaging you are towards political minorities sexual deviants do not comprise a political minorit y again an astounding lack of logic wow you must define what you say such that everyone agrees here you have used the phrase sexual deviant how in the hell do you define that as someone who does something sexually that you don t by this definition you most probably mean the majority of the planet how do you know that your next door neighbour doesn t like custard to be spread over his genetalia then have it licked off by his wife is this sexual deviancy how do we know that you don t like something sexually which others may find repulsive is having sex doggy fashion a sexual deviancy please be more specific and where you do back up your claims or i may have to go to hospital due to laughing too much at yours and clayton s postings secondly if we assume for the moment that the phrase sexual deviant means such people as homosexuals bisexuals c basically everyone you don t like i think that your phrase do not comprise a political minorit y why the brackets is a non sequiteur gay groups exist which lobby their governments that is a fact prove it false hence they are a politial group you state that they are not a political minority are they therefore a political majority i think you boobed really big on this one try thinking about your arguments and if she had any shred of self respect she d be out the door i only associate with girls who do indeed have self respect but were i to find myself with the sort who would be inclined to head out the door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as homosexuality i would encourage her to indeed do so and i would further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on the way out who needs such an airhead prove the first statement please dates phone numbers c again your logic fails again you make statements which you cannot and most probably will not maintain you state that a person girl in this context who considers equal rights for all humans to be an airhead as clayton your best mate would say it just shows how screwed up you are pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet where they belong don t count on it sweetheart oh i can t do anything but count on it after all it is inevitable for it is part of the natural order of things throughout history nature has always asserted itself don t be so arrogant as to assume that this foolish and misguided generation can change the nature of man where practically every other generation has failed greater men than you haven t been able to do this the above most certainly will happen no matter how much you may wish to pretend otherwise proof please proof that homosexuality is not part of the natural order proof that nature has always asserted itself are you saying that nature is a conciousness are you pretending that you have the ability to see

sell bomb the pushers back to the barter age and tax production too um why what s wrong with the act of selling recreational drugs even for mercenary reasons e g getting rich note by selling i mean selling the product to a consenting adult at a mutually agreeable price i point this out in an effort to pre emptively prevent this thread from getting sidetracked onto a flamefest about pushing drugs to schoolchildren or the like and why should the users be subjected to special taxation william december starr note this is a repost of my earlier response to mr starr which was not properly formatted apologies to those who ve seen the following before to explain my position on the war on drugs i offer this drugs and crime a new approach by ken barnes given that the trade in illegal drugs is responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation people who want drugs particularly people who are predisposed to addiction will find a way to get them whether or not they are legally available despite current law enforcement efforts drugs are readily available to those who want them addiction to drugs both legal and illegal is responsible for a significant drain on the productive resources of our country and this occurs in a variety of ways from the cocaine addicted babies who are unable to learn to the spread of disease among addicts to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking a general economic principle of government is that whatever is subsidized you get more of and whatever is taxed you get less of to be most effective in confronting the nation s drug problem some way must be found to utilize these additional powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use less attractive while this country s current efforts to combat legal drugs have succeeded in some respects there is a greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking and designated driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving for example the same cannot be said for the war on illegal drugs there remains a core group of illegal drug users which support international networks of smugglers pushers growers processors kingpins and gangsters these networks and their marketing activities which include drive by shootings corrupting law enforcement authorities and smuggling weapons are directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed in our country every day clearly illegal drugs and rising crime are linked it takes only a moment s reflection to recognize how they are linked the link is money as with this country s failed effort to prohibit alcohol consumption a black market has been created in which greedy local monopolies like the gangsters of a bygone era have profited enormously from their illegal trade the victims of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire but i would argue the drug users themselves were it not for the black market and the violent monopoly of the drug lords drug users might not be the thieves robbers prostitutes and murderers they have become in order to pay the high prices the drug lords demand in the absence of the drug lords most would be i believe simply people with a problem either a moral problem or a medical problem but not a criminal problem let me be clear however i am not advocating that we let the criminals who have been preying on our society for these many years of prohibition off the hook on the contrary the new approach i advocate is one which would not result in either the government or private industry getting into the business of promoting crack cocaine or any other presently illegal drug for that matter neither is it an approach which sees law abiding citizens handing over more and more of their freedom and privacy in an effort to track down illegal drug users until the land of the free and the home of the brave looks like a police state here then is my proposal possession and use of all presently illegal drugs is decriminalized but buying and selling them remains illegal potheads can grow their own marijuana as many already do today other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle if these drugs can be obtained for free or next to nothing why buy them nevertheless there will be those who will seek to sell these noncommercial drugs even at relatively low prices therefore law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices but here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers the victimizers and the drug users their victims upon arrest for any crime suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of if they are found to be a drug user they will be institutionalized until they are clean and only then will they begin to serve their sentence if they choose to cooperate and are already drug free they can begin to serve their sentence right away those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes drug using criminals and this includes drunk and or stoned drivers are separated from their sources of supply thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business institutionalization provides an incentive for drug using criminals to straighten themselves out before becoming part of the general prison population while helping protect society from crime institutionalization could also serve to deter drug users from becoming criminals since drug using criminals unlike other criminals would be delayed prior to serving their sentences by the additional time it takes for them to sober up institutionalization of drug using criminals separate from the general prison population would also provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could volunteer for research studies of new techniques and treatments for addictive disease with the potential to benefit both themselves and others dealers in illegal drugs are generally not drug users themselves and this is particularly true of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit organizations under this proposal dealers would be more readily identifiable since upon arrest they would presumably pass the drug test or else decline to take it in order to avoid having to explain why they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent they do not use them declining to take the test they would of course face stiffer penalties while each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug would have to stand on own its merits the outcome of a suspect s drug test could provide additional evidence for the prosecution just as cigarette taxes have contributed to the decline of smoking in our country by making cigarettes more costly while at the same time providing revenue for anti smoking campaigns noncommercial drugs should be taxed and the money generated should be used to combat their use enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis however and should not be used as an excuse to infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial drug users since to do so would have the effect of reintroducing prohibition instead drug users will be encouraged to pay the tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever found in their possession during the course of routine police operations they will be required to pay the tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to be destroyed if drug dealers are found to be selling noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid they will face additional prosecution for evading the tax the strategy of adding tax evasion to drug dealing charges is already in use in some jurisdictions but its effectiveness is currently limited by the illegality of drug possession revenue from drug possession taxes and import tariffs would be used to fund anti drug advertising campaigns and provide support to private sector drug treatment programs for those unable to afford treatment taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must be ended federal support of tobacco farming is both immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets and the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands in many states must likewise be eliminated while my proposal would have the effect of permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs it would hold the users of all drugs responsible for their actions and i believe would reduce the harm drugs have on our society particularly the crime caused by the illegal drug trade so long as we remain a free nation with relatively porous borders and freedom for our citizens to travel we will always have a drug problem whether it takes the form of heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings drunk drivers killing and maiming others on our streets or emphysema patients struggling for breath after a lifetime of smoking the results are the same needless suffering and death as a society we must recognize that while our society permits us to harm ourselves with drugs as we are already doing regardless of the drug laws we must take a stand against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to others we must particularly oppose the vicious and violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug users by taking the profits out of their deadly trade my proposal goes a long way towards shutting down these powerful criminal organizations the question of whether drug use is a moral or medical problem depends on which group of drug users you re talking about different drugs have different effects and some are more addictive than others the addictiveness of a drug also often varies between individuals and so we have some people who can drink alcohol in moderation while others find they cannot resist the bottle nicotine which former surgeon general c everett koop declared to be as addicting as heroin is a legal drug with known harmful effects and while some people can stop smoking by willpower alone others continue to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer for those individuals who can stop taking drugs on their own we may argue that because they have chosen to use them this represents a moral failure on their part or an unwillingness to face the difficulties of life but for the addicts while they may have chosen to use drugs the first time by the time they discover their addiction it is too late we cannot hold them responsible for their disease any more than we would blame someone who is drowning for an inability to swim perhaps they should have known not to go near the water or perhaps someone should have warned them of the danger but in their present circumstances warnings will not help neither does it help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing them weights

insurance plan no it is optional as it is optional for doctors to accept it there are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for exemptions and one e mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verified for me that it is indeed negative option i guess that you can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance but so far i ve not come across that up north and i take pains to keep tabs with news from home it s optional but what if you don t want basic coverage on the government s terms you said before that if you opt out you re basically uninsured there are two things at work here the public insurance is very wide in what it will cover as the amortization is also universal no private plan can boast of a plan that fits a gaussian curve and as our private sector has discovered they re better off not offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use and that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an effective cartel they don t really need to compete because as you put it they re in a win win situation and they re guaranteed to turn a profit believe me they probably had orgasms when they figured that out and according to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to the point of ungraciousness at chamber of commerce luncheons so in a sense they ve stopped being truly capitalists if they don t have to worry about competing anymore you might say that the total effect is one of socialized medicine a government providing the basics and a cartel providing the extras there is no alternative to the system desirable or not the alternative to the system is no system at all patients opted out doctors opted out or both but that only for insurance and you can t force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they will not offer and remember that the actual health care is delivered by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily again they can t force a private entity to spring to life to pay them plus there is the matter of culture and values i m basically anti tax and anti government by canadian standards yet i can t bring myself to make the same arguments as you do despite that i understand where you re coming from up north you re so much more likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage interesting side note have any new insurance companies started up from scratch since medicare became standard in canada i actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since ww i no scratch that there are a few in western canada and quite a few in quebec as part of the post quebec miracle out with the nationalism in with the french capitalism la groupe des cooper antes built a new tower by the eaton s store at les terraces and if you were able to catch urban angel on cbs s crimetime you d see it as the well lit one with double turrets at the top as for ontario which still dominates and anchors business up north i meant new companies not new buildings yes primarily in quebec and in alberta sorry i musta lost you in that verbose blurb it s not really insurance if you don t have alternatives well you have to realize that in our society that s like saying that it s not really national defence because you can t hire your own rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist true but i would be more comfortable with a system in which basic care provided by the government was optional not mandatory in canada and germany it s not mandatory however it is negative option in that you must request the exemption that the private sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option as in the quebec case tells me something about what they know either way the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp in the light of disasters e g chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart disease a doctor needs years of training plus internship and specialty training another problem with the us system that should be resolved doesn t canada have something like ten times the proportion of gps to specialists that the us does yes but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are too small to sustain many specialists sometimes not even one so you pretty well have to be a gp to get paid and if you do get the training the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a licence because there is already someone in the business and who cannot fill his her appointment book that we have a cma doctors monopoly is something that the american ama oriented medical lobby never tells you down here the problem is in a specialty your skill often directly correlates to your pay a good cardiologist makes more than a merely adequate cardiologist more than it does in general practice in that circumstance it s hard to blame people for going into specialties no i respect people who do specialties okay all of my md friends are but there s the question of our small market dynamics up north if anything that our private doctors and hospitals sell their services to americans to generate more business will inflate their effective population served and thus make some specialties finally viable i e there will be enough customers we just do not have enough sick canadians in absolute numbers otherwise i personally think an approach like germany s would be best where the companies compete for batches of people rochester a little east of us was able to get almost all of its population covered that way uh germany basically uses our method with their many sickness funds the competition is fake if it exists at all because they re all interlinked look in der spiegel or stern my girlfriend is in our german department and her uncle is a private practicioner in saarbrucken no ads for health insurance while canada organizes by province germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations and regional offices but remember that we have provinces that have the same population as some major german corporations germans have public health insurance just that it is brokered by smaller entities actually brokerage of basic by private firms who ll sell extra insurance to fill out their policies sort of a voucher system was one of the first ideas floated in canada too remember the germans don t have hmo s a telling sign cos rochester does and they re also a company town but there was a washington post article recently about that that said canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of mris which require spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches mickey kaus in the new republic probably spoke for most americans when he said who needs that i think people here generally like to believe they can easily get the most high tech treatment even if they really can t afford it i ll have to let a canadian md jump in to verify that claim but i ve come to learn to suspect anything in the american press about our system if much or some of it were true you d have to take us for idiots for tolerating it and given that our insurance was installed during a period when there were only liberal and tory governments federally and provincially and the socialists are still chafing they would ve pressed for real socialized medicine to fix things think about it after all we are using the u s as a metric to make comparison both for keeping up with the joneses as for confirming

writes ok one last time yeah right in order for you to not pay for any abortions through your tax money everyone would have to not pay for any abortions through tax money ok one last time yeah right many who oppose federal funding for abortions would be quite happy simply to specify that their tax money not be used to support programs to which they morally object failing that the house ways and means committee has so far rejected similar proposals their only recourse is to object to the program itself this they do but you don t seem to like that what other choice do you offer you suggest they should not consider how portions of their individual tax money are spent why not suppose you had the option to specify that your tax money can t pay for abortions do you think that that should entitle you to pay less taxes since refusing to fund abortions would lead to an even larger increase in funding for pre natal care and delivery if anything you should pay more taxes suppose we let your taxes stay at the same level do you really think that funding for abortion would be reduced no your taxes would go towards other things and more taxes from those who don t object to paying for abortion would be moved from those other things to pay for abortions all that happens is that the funds get shuffled around to give you a clear conscience why put the government through all that paperwork when the end result is no different why worry about it when it makes no difference and it doesn t hurt you in the least your advice people should stop worrying about where their individual money is going and instead vote for how government should spend all the money it gets currently the duly elected president proposes that federal medical programs include abortions in their coverage if the duly elected congress goes along with it well there you go that is how our system of representation works parenthetical comments removed is similar to the horrible advice some offer potential rape victims it s going to happen anyway so you might as well just lie back and enjoy it that is the most rediculous out of context analogy i have every heard i do not advocate any such advice there is quite a difference between the illegal violation called rape and the constitutionally granted power of taxation along with the funding of legal procedures if you can t see the difference you can go to hell care to respond this time mr parker the following challenges remain unmet by mr parker from his own comments we are left to presume they were too much for him your yanking followups to posts of mine from other threads does not demonstrate any deliberate lack of response on my part there is a great deal of bandwidth on talk abortion and it can take a long time to get through to the followups to articles i have posted and many times responses expire before i get to reading them it is pretty fucking arrogant of you to pull copies here and demand that i respond to them here when they were posted already and quite possibly responded to separately i believe i have indeed responded to some of the following previously though probably not each of them parker ehsn cen uiuc edu robert s parker writes by the way thanks so much for deleting the context of this next line in your followup to it no i have some objective non religious reasons with justification for why personity makes an appropriate value system please define personity and enumerate the reasons which justify it as an appropriate value system i have done so in the past it isn t my fault that you never saw it here is a brief explanation a person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights of another person if you want to hear more about this aspect of personity go read the thread why is bodily autonomy so important on talk abortion you may have to look at all unexpired posts on that thread to find the post where i give a fairly detailed explanation i believe it was posted on april or the second part is a definition of a person a simplistic explanation is that a person is a member of society most normal adult human beings are good examples of people most children over two years old are people as well the simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation with them it is actually more complicated than that but i have no desire to spend the time it would take to explain it to you read the thread why is bodily autonomy so important for more explanation and justification parker ehsn cen uiuc edu robert s parker writes if the government refused to fun abortions due to the qualms of a minority of the population then it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of babies whose mothers wanted an abortion but could not afford one and now that baby will also require care for years have you statistics that demonstrate the majority of the population has no qualm with government funding for abortions i suspect you fail to account for the position of the person who wishes abortion neither banned nor federally funded actually i was refering to the minority that objects to abortion not those who object to federal funding i admit i did not say it very clearly and apologize for that do you have statistics that might answer this question or are you just blowing smoke a pro choice president of who ran was elected that means the country basically supports the choice to have an abortion surely you don t wish to suggest the recent presidential election was nothing more than a nationwide referendum on the abortion issue i said what i said if you had not deleted most of it everyone could see for themselves what i said to refuse to fund abortions is to remove that choice from some women and add the additional burden to society for no reason are we simply to take it on your authority that there is no reason if you disagree then give us some reasons given that abortion is legal and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the population or can you provide unbiased statistics i doubt you can because i have never heard of an unbiased poll that has been conducted it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford them who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you would force upon them i refuse to pay more taxes to remove choice from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure where does it end to refuse to fund the free distribution of guns is to remove the choice to own a gun from some women and add the burden of police protection to society more guns in society does not reduce the burden on the police it increases it to refuse to provide everyone with an automobile is to remove the choice to drive from some women and add the additional burden of public transportation to society now this is rediculous public transportation puts less of a burden on transportation routes roads rails etc than private transportation it also puts a lesser burden on the environment to refuse to fund a jobs for everyone is to remove the choice to work from some women and add the additional burden of unemployment to society oh this makes sense ever hear of welfare know what it s all about parker ehsn cen uiuc edu robert s parker writes not to mention the fact that the people who would get the death penalty are convicted of horrible crimes senseless murders multiple murders and so on one could argue that these people have no right to live in our society please show us this argument i suspect it is quite strained as it must include those wrongly convicted who remain innocent regardless of the severity of the crimes i said one could argue it i didn t say it was a convincing argument we do not want them ever and we should not have to pay to keep them alive for as long as they happen to live first infants now certain adults does anyone have a right to life mr parker if so precisely who not infants you idiot infants are born who has a right to life people who have not violated other s rights have a right to life a fetus is not a person you can not have a conversation with them they are not biologically independent their awareness is questionable they have no experiences in the real world to make up a personality parker ehsn cen uiuc edu robert s parker writes hudson athena cs uga edu paul hudson jr writes if its a matter of money we could save a lot of money by killing off anyone with an expensive illness it may decrease our population a bit but we will have plenty of money to go around hey why not oh wait maybe their family members would object ya think their parents children brothers sisters is that the case with abortion and if no family member objects should we allow this killing should we include it as a cost saving device in our health care reform package these questions are not rhetorical ever hear of euthanasia ever hear of insurance companies refusing to fund potentially life saving treatment because they don t feel

regain control of the land their servants in washington handed over to a foreign interest and to establish an enterprise thereon whether a museum or otherwise informed by and conducted according to american principles and interests photograph captioned the five story million us holocaust memorial museum in washington d c was built and is operated by a taxpayer funded federal agency in the foreground is the museum s six sided hall of remembrance origins in the late s during the presidency of james earl jimmy carter a propaganda campaign to promote the holocaust the alleged systematic slaughter of some million jews by the germans during world war ii was organized and carried out from hollywood and new york as benjamin meed an important functionary of the council which controls the holocaust museum wrote in almost a dozen years ago a new phenomena sic developed the holocaust was introduced into schools colleges and universities television broadcast programs on the holocaust and millions of americans watched them soon americans took great interest in the lessons of the holocaust its uniqueness and its universal message why the urgency of this campaign two factors were paramount first the beginnings more than three decades after the end of world war ii of an objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged german policy to exterminate european jewry second the need to justify zionist theory and practice in the face of unprecedented international resistance to israeli intransigence including the famous un general assembly resolution which equated zionism with racism and to defend israel s aggressive policy under the leadership of the former terrorist prime minister menachem begin the u s holocaust memorial council in president carter his administration beleaguered at home and abroad succumbed to pressure from the new holocaust lobby and thus america s influential israel first minority by creating through executive order the president s commission on the holocaust two years later on october congress passed unanimously a law establishing the united states holocaust memorial council charged principally with constructing and overseeing the operation of a permanent living memorial to the victims of the holocaust and with providing for appropriate ways for the nation to commemorate the days of remembrance as an annual national civic commemoration of the holocaust a priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council and after years of costly delay during which the u s holocaust memorial council s budget swelled from million to over million a year the u s holocaust memorial museum has been completed and readied for opening on april a sectarian alien agenda the holocaust memorial council besides soliciting tens of millions of dollars in tax deductible donations to finance the holocaust museum has busied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority zionist ends the membership of the council a u s federal agency has been overwhelmingly jewish since its founding in the council s two different chairmen elie wiesel and harvey meyerhoff have both been committed to the support of the state of israel and the chairs of the council s most important committees have been likewise jewish and zionist the chief fundraiser for the holocaust museum miles lerman was formerly american vice chairman for the state of israel bonds organization promoting tax free investment in a country which receives by far the largest amount of u s foreign aid per year working the same wealthy jewish americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for israel lerman has helped raise nearly million in tax deductible contributions the biggest donors have been rewarded by having various components of the museum named for them e g the wexler learning center nor is erecting and operating the holocaust memorial museum the only function with which the holocaust memorial council has been charged another of its duties is to commemorate the days of remembrance for victims of the holocaust which congress has raised to an annual national civic commemoration of the holocaust like the israeli yom hashoah day of the holocaust on which they are based the days of remembrance are dated according to the lunar hebrew calendar and thus like passover or chanukah fluctuate from year to year these foreign days of lamentation are currently celebrated under the flag of the republic to prayers and chants in hebrew in governmental settings from the capital rotunda to city halls across the land need it be stated that no group of american victims of persecution let alone another foreign group enjoys any such federally mandated and tax supported day or days of recognition the holocaust museum s one sided history although the u s holocaust memorial council during its early years made noises about recognizing the ordeals of non jews during world war ii by every indication from advance literature published by the council the u s holocaust memorial museum is relentlessly judeocentric while according to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit here and there are nods to non jewish groups oppressed by the german national socialists never to groups victimized by germany s enemies above all by stalin s ussr the larger holocaust of world war ii which claimed an estimated to million lives around the world is ignored in preference to the jewish ordeal thus to cite just one telling example the museum s life before the holocaust exhibit refers strictly to jewish life before the holocaust where in fact non jews figure in the museum they figure largely as villains the germans and their allies and collaborators the western allies including america who refused to accept a large immigration before the war the american political and military leaders who refused to authorize costly bombing raids on the auschwitz gas chambers red liberators the museum s message that support for jews is the sole measure of decency during world war ii leads to anomalies which in an american museum raised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which this republic is based can only be called shocking that the victims of world war ii atrocities by the allies massacres such as the fire bombing of tokyo and dresden the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki the soviet slaughter of their polish prisoners at katyn the mass rapes carried out by the red army at the war s end receive no mention is deplorable but the museum s treatment of the armed forces which defended stalin s savage soviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque in the u s holocaust memorial museum communists appear only in the guise of resistance fighters and liberators for example the submachine gun and false papers of samuel weissberg a communist party member who rose to high rank in a communist guerrilla group in north france are on honored display no less precious a relic than the standard heaps of shoes and hair in the museum s permanent exhibit even more unsettling is the honor given to stalin s notorious red army which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities across europe during and after the war as the u s holocaust memorial council s newsletter fulsomely puts it flags will hang in the museum to honor the millions of soviet soldiers who drove nazi forces westward and who were the first allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence of the camps in the words of council chairman harvey meyerhoff these martial banners of the red tyranny have a single association much more than simply wartime memorabilia these military artifacts are a significant contribution to memory one that will remind future generations of the pivotal role soviet forces played in defeating nazism what must the millions of americans originating or descending from the european nations russia ukraine belarus estonia latvia lithuania poland hungary czechoslovakia romania bulgaria former yugoslavia for which the red military artifacts symbolized invasion tyranny oppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armies of their persecutors hailed as liberators israel in the museum just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum s director yeshayahu weinberg and the head of its learning center yechiam halevy were brought in from israel the museum s treatment of the state of israel is adulatory an emotive tribute to the founding of israel is an integral part of the exhibition that the establishment of israel and its expansion in subsequent wars has meant colonial occupation and oppression for millions of the land s native palestinians and dispossession and exile for millions more goes unmentioned another grotesquery in an american museum supposed to instruct in the dangers of intolerance and disregard of human rights as for the momentous collaboration between hitler s german state and the jewish agency in the s which through the ha avara agreement enabled the transfer of vital capital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled jewish immigrants to palestine that is passed over in utter silence historical correctness the holocaust museum s skewed history is not simply a matter of one sidedness and omission the museum has further committed itself to a fixed and final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspect evidence for a german policy of annihilating european jewry largely in gas chambers in numbers approaching million this despite a considerable body of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decades in many lands and which contests by academic means the substance of the holocaust extermination thesis that the u s holocaust memorial council is aware of the work of the revisionists is clear the council s literature is replete not with substantive refutations of revisionist scholarship but with slander and polemic to cite one characteristic example the u s holocaust memorial museum newsletter of may featured a front page attack on holocaust revisionism by professor deborah lipstadt of occidental college in which the author decried the revisionists for producing material that looked scholarly then lauded the u s holocaust memorial museum as among the most efficacious ways of combating this pernicious trend while neglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship the u s holocaust memorial council recognizes that there is a historical debate on the holocaust but takes official notice of the dissenting position only to attack it that an american institution supported by the taxes of all americans should commit itself to inflexible historical orthodoxy in the service of a single american minority is an intolerable imposition on our first amendment rights as well as a mockery of the western and american ideal of objective scholarship a center for education u s holocaust memorial council chairman harvey meyerhoff has stated the museum is primarily an educational institution from the council s own literature however it is clear what meyerhoff means by education the role playing for children as well as adults who visit the museum visitors are to be issued identity cards bearing the name and alleged fate of various holocaust victims the high tech computer and video effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment the museum s tendentiously described artifacts and the museum s goal as proclaimed by its zionist fundraising chairman miles lerman of ensuring that children in dubuque families in tucson and schoolteachers in atlanta will learn the history and the lessons of auschwitz as thoroughly as they learn the history of their own communities all these show that the u s holocaust memorial museum is a propaganda enterprise that seeks to indoctrinate all americans in a uniquely and partisanly jewish and zionist version of not merely the past but the present and the future the american response what is the american response to a partisan museum constructed in a place solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic to be lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when even in our country s capital thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our national monuments what is the american response to an ambitious propaganda agenda that aims to impose a sectarian holocaust remembrance in schools where our children cannot pray in town halls and federal buildings from which the religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom of worship over two centuries ago thomas jefferson wrote to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical nearly years ago abraham lincoln said i insist that if there is anything which it is the duty of the whole people to never entrust to any hands but their own that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of their own liberties and institutions the u s holocaust memorial museum and the council which runs it as agencies of the government in which the american people is sovereign must be removed from the special interest that now controls it the scope and purpose of the museum must be expanded from its present one sided emphasis on foreign jewish sufferings real and imagined in europe during the s and s to a compassionate yet realistic concern for all victims but above all for american victims of historic injustice the museum must be made a place where americans of every heritage and scholars of every viewpoint may gather educate and be educated without accusation and in the absence of propaganda until it is the men and

of trauma services at st michael s hospital in toronto responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in california and canada in which some canadian doctor worried that that study which was in the nejm i think noted that the frequency of heart surgery on patients over seventy increase with income in california i guess richer people have more heart disease in california whereas the frequency of surgery on patients over seventy in canada was relatively uniform across income distribution heart surgery was more frequent in california but mortality and outcomes were essentially the same american analysts would seize on the results as proof that canada rationed vital services the doctor i can t recall his name said that canada is rationing vital services as any physician can plainly see he said that a system in which people are refused treatment because they can t afford it is no different from a system in which people are refused treatment because the government can t afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health insurance plan in fairness he did say that both the us and canadian systems are in the same situation the ndp cleaning up a tory spending mess and just when i thought i understood canadian politics there was one about a group of doctors in calgary who have opened canada s first us style mri clinic as an alternative to the provincially owned one it s about time i ve ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they don t invest in their own private practices in the end it s their money but they choose to spend it on america s cup pipedreams and that s none of my business as for provincially owned for sure it s against the law in canada for governments to be directly involved in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser vations what that term actually means is that the facility gets by on public grants to meet shortfall from lack of use no kidding medical practice itself is much more conservative up north my own best friend did two clerkships at the mayo clinic in rochester mn and is no stranger to high tech medicine but his boat comes first there were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of two tiered health care and that it might violate the canada health act no it s probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have private practices and always have they can all take cash anyways so why not have a particular facility the canadian big government mentality often imagines government where it does not even exist the only potential problem i see with the private mri facilty in calgary is the self referral problem to the facility for the doctors who have a financial interest in it which is basically unethical but in canada because of our small population there is likely only to be a few private facilities involving only a small number of doctors and thus i don t think the self referral problem which is an epidemic in the us could ever get out of hand here look nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the mri nobody stopped them when they bought it nobody seems to be stopping them from using it either much ado about nothing thank goodness that hockey playoffs have started it is an experiment that will be certainly be watched carefully while it seemed currently unjustified there was one anecdote told by the head of the partnership to demonstrate the mri he showed an image of an injured knee which happened to belong to the manager of the bank who approved the loan he said that without it the guy might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial mri then another length of time for treatment after which the muscles would have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder if that isn t the first whiff of two tiers i don t know what is i m certain there is exaggeration somewhere because the gao study of canada cited often on usenet did not find access to mri to be a problem i ll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened to american trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit there are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without relying on mri unfortunately i ve had a few and i m not a banker what likely happened is the sponsors of the private mri which include doctors anticipated that alberta would need more mri s and instead of waiting for the health planners to realize they needed another one or two saw a business opportunity where they would have a secure business from the public insurance side of things and they could supplement

question and answer session with the press the rose garden p m edt the president on february the th four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective a day standoff ensued the federal bureau of investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life the bureau s efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing david koresh was dangerous irrational and probably insane he engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency he was moreover responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in february given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi designed to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it was hoped force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender i was informed of the plan to end the siege i discussed it with attorney general reno i asked the questions i thought it was appropriate for me to ask i then told her to do what she thought was right and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday s action ended in a horrible human tragedy mr koresh s response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive he killed those he controlled and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued now we must review the past with an eye towards the future i have directed the united stated departments of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why and whether anything could have been done differently i have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation i expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review finally i have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances again i want to say as i did yesterday i am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in waco i hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks and i hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now q mr president can you first of all tell us why after days you decided q mr president can you describe for us what it is that janet reno outlined to you in your minute phone conversation with the president i can t hear you both if one will go first and then the other q sorry can you describe what janet reno q mr president the president i ll answer both your questions but i can t do it at once q can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it the president yes i was told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound and she described generally what the operation would be that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building and it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside i was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon they were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire in fact as you know an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials there were no shots coming back from the government side i asked a number of questions the first question i asked is why now we have waited seven weeks why now the reasons i was given were the following number one that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there they might be needed in other parts of the country number two that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult members to come out number three that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time and number four that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions so for those reasons they wanted to move at that time the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good she said that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time the third question i asked was has the military been consulted as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco that s the first thing i asked to be done because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation military people were then brought in helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it and so i asked if the military had been consulted the attorney general said that they had and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance having asked those questions and gotten those answers i said that if she thought it was the right thing to do that she should proceed and that i would support it and i stand by that today q mr president the president wait go ahead q can you address the widespread perception reported widely television radio and newspapers that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster the president no i m bewildered by it the only reason i made no public statement yesterday let me say the only reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold there was i have i can t account for why people speculated one way or the other but i talked to the attorney general on the day before the action took place i talked to her yesterday i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry king show and i talked to her again this morning a president it is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control i will say this however i was frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves applause i regret what happened but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance these people killed four federal officials in the line of duty they were heavily armed they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly and they were never fired back on we did everything we could to avoid the loss of life they made the decision to immolate themselves and i regret it terribly and i feel awful about the children but in the end the last comment i had from janet reno is when and i talked to her on sunday i said now i want you to tell me once more why you believe not why they believe why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she said it s because of the children they have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they re in increasingly unsafe conditions and that they don t think it will get any easier with time with the passage of time i have to take their word for that so that is where i think things stand q can we assume then that you don t think this was mishandled in view of the outcome that you didn t run out of patience and if you had it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no well i think what you can assume is just exactly what i announced today this is a the fbi has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety split record time we want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way is there something else we should have known is there some other question they should have asked is there some other question i should have asked can i say for sure that no one that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different i don t know that that s why i want the inquiry and that s why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non political outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have there is unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world and we may have to confront it again and i want to know whether there is anything we can do particularly when there are children involved but i do think it is important to recognize that the wrong doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves q mr president were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from february th until yesterday the president well yes i got regular reports all along the way there were lots of other options pursued if you go back you all covered it very well the fbi you did a very good job of it i mean the fbi and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way and a lot of them early on seemed to be working some of the children got out some of the other people left there was a at one point there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the authorities and then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward whether there were other in terms of what happened yesterday the conversation i had with the attorney general did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing because they said they wanted to do this because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves that s what they thought q did the government know that the children did not have gas masks q congressional hearings once the situation are you in agreement with that the president that s up to the congress they can do whatever they want but i think it s very important that the treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts and as i said in my statement if any congressional committees want to look into it we will fully cooperate there is nothing to hide here this was probably the most well covered operation of its kind in the history of the country go ahead sarah q there are two questions i want to ask you the first is i think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did so the children had no chance because this gas was very she said it was not lethal but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks and on february th let s go back didn t those people have a right to practice their religion the president they were not just practicing their religion they were the treasury department believed that they had violated federal laws any number of them q what federal laws the president let me go back and answer i can t answer the question about the gas masks except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested they were convinced that it wouldn t kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside and one of the things that i ve heard i don t want to get into the details of this because i don t know but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn t have the desired effect they also knew sarah that there was an underground compound a bus buried underground where the children could be sent and they were i think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected in terms of the gas masks themselves i learned yesterday i did not ask this fact question before that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work so that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent nonshooting circumstance ms myers last question q mr president why are you still saying that q could you tell us whether or not you ever asked janet reno about the possibility of a mass suicide and when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments the president what i asked janet reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen and she said and of course the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public he had that had been debated anyway and she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future that was the judgment they made whether they were right or wrong of course we will never know what happened when i saw the fire when i saw the building burning i was sick i felt terrible and my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside trying to burn themselves up that s the first thing i wanted to know thank you q mr president why are you still saying it was a janet reno decision isn t it in the end your decision the president well what i m saying is that i didn t have a four or five hour detailed briefing from the fbi i didn t go over every strategic part of it it is a decision for which i take responsibility i m the president of the united states and i signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call when i talked to her on sunday some time had elapsed she might have made a decision to change her mind i said if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow i will support you and i do support her she is not ultimately responsible to the american people i am but i think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation i think as well as she could have thank you applause end p m edt,talk.politics.misc

of compliance was grossly disproportionate to the damage faced by plaintiffs bang here s one of the places where we widely diverge you believe that the courts in deciding a civil dispute between two parties should consider as a factor perhaps as an overriding factor issues which i believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute boomer v atlantic cement co was an action brought by one party boomer whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by another party the atlantic cement company the facts supported boomer s contention that atlantic cement was wrongfully damaging his property and boomer asked the court to order atlantic cement to stop doing so end of story there was no reason for the court to consider such issues as what a capitalistic society would want atlantic cement to do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage faced by the plaintiffs those issues had nothing to do with the case before the court bill if the government had stepped in and the epa made a regulation requiring multi million dollar cement plants to be shut down because of a smattering of cement dust at a cost benefit ratio of you d be up in arms why is it okay for the judicial branch to interfere this way but not the legislative or executive branches i d be up in arms why do you assume that quite the contrary i d probably support the action since it would be based on the same general doctrine as the decision that i believe would have been correct in boomer the idea that people s property rights should not be violated for reasons of economic efficiency in boomer it was boomer s property rights which i believe the court should have protected in the hypothetical epa ruling you ve presented it s the american people s collective property rights in a healthy physical environment what good is cost benefit ratio of if you wind up with cement dust in your air your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant if the state of massachusetts came up with a similar regulation you d be up in arms and complaining about interference with property rights and fifth amendment violations once again why is it okay for the judicial branch to interfere this way but not the legislative or executive branches or are you not the libertarian you present yourself as being ted frank how would it be per se illegal to operate a cement plant wouldn t it just mean that when buying land for a cement plant you would have to either buy enough land so that most of the pollution would stay on your land or buy pollution easements from the surrounding landowners tim smith all it takes is one holdout out of hundreds of neighbors to scrap the plant furthermore each of the neighbors is going to want the full benefit of the bargain under the resulting bilateral monopoly a bonanza for lawyers to be sure who get to negotiate each of these agreements a windfall for homeowners who can extort away any profits the plant would make but not particularly good for society yes so what the courts are supposed to protect the specific rights of individuals not the general interests of some nebulous society if society can have its cement plant without violating anyone s rights fine otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less cement plant see ted i really am a libertarian after all that s the whole point behind the coase theorem in a world without transactions costs the land will automatically be put to the best use as it is transferred from person to person instantaneously without friction the legal regime will not matter because the result will be the same in a world such as ours one with transactions costs one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with in order to minimize the transactions costs one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with in order to minimize the transactions costs which one are you speaking of i want the legal regime to protect people s rights besides coase s theorem only has real application in the never never land of perfectly rational actors in the real world some people are going to be stubborn ornery spiteful or otherwise irrational from a economic point of view and the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so i don t care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing of damage to my property per head so i should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for say per head i still retain the right to tell you that i just plain don t want any damned cattle on my property not at any price and then you say everyone s property rights were protected the plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were avoided as above i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were made whole they were in fact by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them wdstarr then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made whole because the award of damages in involuntary why should we treat a nuisance plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff we don t require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation why in tort last question first for the same reason as in contract law because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the thirteenth amendment as to your then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made whole because the award of damages in involuntary claim you re at least partially right faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and cannot be reversed or undone courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer in these cases the sale has already taken place and is irreversible and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid under the doctrines that a only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and b even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere but neither is relevant to cases like boomer in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and can be reversed undone i e prevented from happening at all by order of the court in these types of cases all the court has to do is require that the potential victim s property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually acceptable price there is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding it can leave that operation up to the parties themselves and again i ask since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that unnecessary settlement costs are avoided if so i ve been miseducated i always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive in cases like boomer they re simply a cost of doing business the fact that the proprietors of the atlantic cement co got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without first trying to negotiate with boomer and everyone else whose property rights they d be violating via the operation of their plant there s nothing punitive or unjust about it it is completely sensible only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and the alleged right of several hundred atlantic cement employees to not have their jobs disappear should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by atlantic cement s wrongful acts wdstarr anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire set of possessions to wronged person weren t you complaining about excess punitive damages before anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be required to buy the right to do so from the victim in advance and the seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege no injustice no punitive damages you d like posner bill he s a libertarian really i didn t know that what if anything has he had to say about cases like boomer wdstarr in eal he cites it as an example of bilateral monopoly that the court correctly avoided i m sure its covered in the landes and posner book on tort law presumably favorably but i don t have that book in front of me doesn t sound very much like a libertarian to me libertarians tend to believe in the rights of individual people not societies i ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as law and economics is weak if it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many tie breaker factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute as measured by the scale of justice is evenly balanced fine but as illustrated by boomer it is not fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case wdstarr in this case the justice of the case was intricately tied up with the economics of the case atlantic cement committed a tort causing k of damage should it pay in the millions or just compensate for the damage it committed as stated above the tort was ongoing atlantic cement wanted to be able to continue to violate boomer s rights while the court may have been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already committed it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the future violations of boomer s rights and to then force boomer to sell at that price william december starr wdstarr athena mit edu,talk.politics.misc

gov date thu apr gmt lines in article pdb kilimanjaro jpl nasa gov pdb ipl jpl nasa gov paul bartholomew writes a very well put together post i disagree with several key points but the post is an excellent one with which to engage in discourse there has been much discussion recently about the right to freedom of association mr cramer and mr ronzone appear to take an absolutist position on this right that it is a fundamental human right perhaps the fundamental human right and that it supersedes other rights such as the right to an equal opportunity others feel that a right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and thus we have the never ending debate that flares up repeatedly freedom of association foa involves the mutual and voluntary agreement of two or more people right to equal opportunity lets call it reo involves coercion in all cases by definition a major problem is that neither of these rights are explicitly declared or protected in the constitution or in the declaration of independence although both can be derived from these documents unfortunately this means that the debate will never end because neither side can conclu sively prove the validity of their view it becomes solely a matter of personal philosophy yes there is much debate but no it can end with once and for all recognition of these rights well not totally perfect end but end in the same way that there is no worldwide disagreement that say murder is a crime my personal opinion is that the real answer lies somewhere in between i regard both of these rights as fundamental human rights which unfortu nately come into direct conflict with one another which is stronger depends on the given situation hmm there is even more discusion about religion should we take a somewhere in between approach towards the state a state recognized religion the first amendment is so uh so absolutist you know for example if the owner of a mom and pop store wishes to hire an employee to help out their right to freedom of association outweighs the rights of their job applicants to an equal opportunity they should be free to hire whomever they choose using whatever criteria they choose without any government intervention at all similarly if a family wishes to rent out a bedroom in their home or a garage apartment or something similar then their right to freedom of association outweighs the rights of their prospective tenants to an equal opportunity if on the other hand ibm a multi national corporation with employees publicly owned and operated by a board of directors wishes to hire additional employees then whose freedom of association are we protecting the board of directors the other employees the owners of the stock in this case the applicant s right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and we as a society can ask ibm to use only those criteria which are relevant to the specific task why says who why can mon pop have foa but ibm be forced and force is the correct word here to have reo as purchase of ibm is voluntary then there are very well defined procedures on how ibm chooses to do some things and chooses to do other things why not let those same procedures work for employment policies similarly if a landlord owns a number of apartment buildings in which he does not live and which are managed by an independent management agency then whose freedom of association are we protecting if the owner does not live in his buildings and has no contact with his tenants then the prospective tenant s right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and we as a society can ask the owner to use only those criteria which are relevant to good tenants i ve put good in quotation marks because i really don t want to be drawn off into the side issue of what constitutes a good tenant why does this tenant have an option i won t call it a right to destroy the foa of the landlord if the landlord and the tenant can t agree then they both can cease from using each other s property suddenly by arm waving by magic a landlord does not have foa and on what basis does the foa of the landlord disappear it seems that vague terms like no contact with tenants suffice well i think foa is one our most important rightts in the top and by golly if the state is going to make it suffer i sure would like to see the heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right i don t think no contact with the tenats is even a crime much less something that should cause severe interference with important rights i suspect that the majority of the people in this country agree with my position on these extreme cases particularly if they are presented in this manner i don t know if mr ronzone or mr cramer would agree i suspect not in any case additional problems arise when we try to apply guidelines for the middle ground what if the company has employees or or where do we draw the line between protecting the right to freedom of association and protecting the right to an equal opportunity rights are not defined by majority mob choice foa is an absolute reo is a fancy name for thuggery for racism and coercion the difficulty is that any line we draw will of necessity be artificial and any legislation resulting will be flawed in the past the government has usually tried to pass laws which referred to the number of employees hired by the company e g any company with more than xxx employees was affected by the law those with fewer were unaffected of course it would be you dimly see that the line must be artifiacial because foa is the only right just like a state religion you can t jsutify that either generally i believe that if we do not have any regulations affecting these rights then the right to freedom of association will be stronger on the other hand many of the regulations protect the right to an equal opportunity too much weakening the right to freedom of association i don t believe there is a satisfactory solution which will please everybody a solution that i came up with is to use publicly owned vs privately owned as the dividing line if the company remains privately owned then the owners should be free to do whatever they want with their company if the company becomes publicly owned then the public has a right to ask the company to submit to additional regulation why i assume that when you say publicly owned you are talking about those quasi state companys that do not have shareholders the companies on the fortune for example are all privately owned they can give you a list of all of their owners they have no anonymous unknown to them owners by the way the above analysis is based on the assumption that the right to freedom of association and the right to an equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal importance since this is entirely a matter of faith not subject to any proof i do not choose to even try to establish this you either accept it or you don t any comments foa can be derived by any two rational people on a basis that neither has evil malicious or murderous intent towards the others in short agreement is mutual or not at all your reo on the other hand lives only by accepting coercion the gun into the situation and that is self destructive of the whole argument because it is based only on might makes right sort of like saying nobody has a right to live whereupon i whip out a gun and shoot you dead end of argument there are actually people that still believe love canal was some kind of

sell your shirt and buy one and they told him master we have two swords and he said it is enough luke think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but the sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daugher against her mother matt well when the nice federal officers come to my house to check out my extensive weapons cache i ll just be sure not to shoot at them tea ladies and gentlemen just maybe you won t be home then you can come home to something like this well it s been a rough month begins johnnie lawmaster i just get laid off and my divorce became final but i just wasn t ready for what happened this particular monday that particular monday was was december the first day of the bill of rights third century the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in tulsa that always flew the u s flag when lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon one of his neighbors had some news ohmigod john you are in big trouble my neighbor tells me sixty police federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house kicked down the door cut locks off your gun safe i couldn t believe it then i walked inside what a nightmare it was no nightmare it was horribly real life apparently acting on information the lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm some thirty agents of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms batf teamed up with state and tulsa police authorities search warrant in hand to search for a colt ar caliber machine gun unknown serial number the warrant issued by u s magistrate john leo wagner also authorized agents to seize any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms such as files or drills documents papers books records and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched reports vary but according to neighbors the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some agents and local law enforcement personnel against lawmaster they cordoned off the street took station with weapons drawn in the back yard used a battering ram to break through the front door kicked in the back door broke into his gun safe threw personal papers around the house spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor broke into a small locked box that contained precious coins stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles breaking the table in the process then they left the doors were closed but not latched much less locked the ammo and guns were left unsecured my front and back doors were pulled shut but they were busted through and couldn t latch anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything i own a child could have taken a gun the guns the safe everything was open and laying around i keep all my magazines empty but someone had loaded them while i was looking around in amazement the gas electric and water companies show up to turn the power off they said they were told to shut things down then i found the note nothing found atf they didn t make any attempt to notify me i ve lived in tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket how come they can t look that up realize i ve been law abiding my whole life then come to the door when i m home they didn t leave someone here to watch over my private property they didn t even come by to explain what happened they just raided my home ransaked it left it wide open and left lawmaster placed a phone call to the local batf agent i asked are you gonna arrest me and he said no i asken him who is going to repair and clean up my house and he said if you re going to talk to me come down to my office i can t come down i said my doors are broken if i had been on vacation and i didn t have friendly neighbors i would have lost everything i own here i am a competent responsible firearms owner and the government leaves them open unlocked with ammo strewn around lawmaster said the agent advised him if you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock you re gonna have to pay for it yourself oh i ll come right down alright i told him i ll come down but i ll bring my attorney and he said well you bring your attorney and we won t talk to you so if you don t want your tea party to be held in awkward silence make sure your lawyer isn t there there s a good

weinberg and rice in the finding that of the male population is actively homosexual with an further breakdown bell wienberg of exclusively so and self identifying themselves as bisexuals pp as for debunking kinsey the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read was kinsey a fake and a pervert by philip nobile far out on the grassy knoll of sexology there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late alfred kinsey was a secret sex criminal a hoosier dr mengele who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids but what really riles these critics is kinsey s towerin cultural influence his bestselling surveys sexual behavior in the human male and sexual behavior in the human female tore the sheets off the country s erogenous zones and undermined midcentury morals his charts and graphs based on detailed histories of men and women demonstrated that practices generally considered rare and or abnormal masturbation extramarital relations homosexuality and even barnyard bestiality were as american as strawberry shortcake yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists aided and abetted by pat buchanan and the religious right the zoology professor from indiana university remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character assassination judith reisman the prosecution s expert witness at the mapplethorpe trial in cincinnati is the leader of the anti kinsey revisionists as well as his inspector javert in during a radio interview with pat buchanan in washington reisman accused kinsey of having been inolved in the vicious genital torture of hundreds of children she speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests now seven years later reisman has revived her charges in a different book titled kinsey sex and fraud just released by the small and religiously oriented huntington house in lafayette louisiana her coauthor is ed eichel a manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission the coital alignment technique that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the sexes in the book eichel contends that kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because being an oddball himself he wanted to advance the denormalization of heterosexuality if the authors are right then the world famous kinsey reports are as the introduction boldly asserts the most egregious example of scientific deception in this century and if they are wrong kinsey sex and fraud is a shameful smear despite the less than stellar credentials of kinsey s detractors legends are not what they used to be martin luther king may have committed plagiarism bruno bettelheim slapped young mental patients around father bruce ritter the founder of covenant house preyed on runaway boys closer to kinsey masters and johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or another so it should not surprise anybody that kinsey who filmed strange people having sex in his attic may have had skeletons in the closet the problem is that reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the job as a thinker the woman is no madame curie the year old former songwriter for captain kangaroo has little professional standing no current university position and no peer review publications though her creative resume was padded with phantom accomplishments for instance it listed a book as her own take back the night women on pornography that was actually written and edited by others then there is her ph d in speech communication from cleveland s case western reserve university although reisman has no bachelor s degree case granted her a master s in and a doctorate in her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian tv commentator but on the resume reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy hautes etudes moniker to wit the application of aristotelian and systems analytic theory to mass media effects when reisman burst into prominence on buchanan s program it was love at first sight for al regnery the outwardly anti porn head of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention in ed meese s justice department regnery was a young law and order conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the united states after reisman s sensational radio session the sexual equivalent of joe mccarthy s wheeling speech regnery summoned her to meetings to discuss mutual interests first he tried to shovel her for a quasi frankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing photographs guffaws on capitol hill killed the original proposal but in govemment money went to reisman anyway for plan b a probe of child images in the cartoons playboy penthouse and hust ler incredibly this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney general s pornography commission when the overpriced and oversold project was completed in it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed justice department that spring regnery resigned from his post only days before the new republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the house notwithstanding the six figure humiliation reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony right as the darling of the sex cranks she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in men s magazines and blames aids on gays kinsey sex and fraud is reisman s latest grasp for respectability pat buchanan of course is putting his krugerrands on reisman s ultimate vindication this book is social dynamite he says in a blurb an the front cover he especially liked the antigay parts smacking his lips in his syndicated column he declared it may just blow the sewer cap off kinsey s monumental reputation reestablish homosexuality as a in aberration expose the gay rights movement as a paper tiger and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon dr kinsey s research the blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive j accuse is that kinsey was a sex mad pedophile who molested little boys in nazi type experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume a similar charge was first recited at the fifth world conference on sexology in jerusalem in to no effect before being recycled by reisman for buchanan in washington in here is how reisman and eichel repackaged the mengele business in kinsey sex and fraud mengele like scientific experiments on infants and children were the basis for kinsey s conclusions on childhood sexuality somewhere and sometime in the course of the project kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost years this of course would implicate kinsey and his team in promoting and perhaps participating in the criminal activity in the opinion of this book s authors that is exactly how part of kinsey s child sexuality research took place donning his psychohistorian s cap and citing an fbi manual on child molesters as a guide eichel casually diagnoses kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as reisman said kinsey placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys such as y m c a camp counselor boys club leader and boy scout leader activities he kept up during his college and graduate yeaers and even after his marriage as crude as his analysis seems eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone interview if you ve ever been around boy lovers pedophiles they are absolutely compulsive he averred everything in his life is directed at getting children i didn t mention this in our book but the caption under kinsey s high school picture was a quote from hamlet man delights me not no sic nor woman neither what do you think they were picking up on before weighing what reisman and eichel pass off as proof of kinsey s sex crimes something must be said about kinsey s scientific modus operandi he was a fiendish collector as a young zoologist with a d sc from harvard he collected million gall wasps and million related insects when he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage course at indiana university in he was no less curious or acquisitive nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to him he compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral eroticism naturally the sexual response of children the genesis of eros fascinated him it was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their origins and so with the fervor of his bughunting days kinsey collected information about kids though even his worst enemies until reisman and eichel refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our disposal although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers he treated the documentary materia of the pedophiles as pure gold there was nothing like it in the literature kinsey s main source a year old govemment worker was also the most unforgettable character he had ever met this man whose history took hours to log had sex with over boys and girls as well as of family members including his father and grandmother a sexual hobbyist and passionate record keeper he gave kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent boys relying on the man s meticulous research which involved following some boys for as long as years kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release as well as the speed and the capacity of climax what freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality kinsey had reported as fact children were indeed erotic beings from the cradle these data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy he concluded without raising eyebrows in then along came judith reisman ignorng the legitimacy of kinsey s inquiry she beheld the ghost of mengele in bloomington she was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker and she dared to say that kinsey was a sex criminal well was he or wasn t he let s go to the text there is no evidence in kinsey sex and fraud no witnesses no paper noteven a trace of hearsay that implicates kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex experiments after years on the trail reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge amazingly enough kinsey himself and wardell pomeroy kinsey s coauthor on both reports to whom reisman has never spoken it turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in pomeroy s biography titled dr kinsey and the institute for sex research after frisking every the and and in both books reisman came up with what she believes are smoking sentences to establish kinsey s alleged role in the planning she says that there is a hint in the fifth chapter of the male volume that kinsey directed the orgasm studies on kids she cites his tell tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that writers test their theories by empirical study and statistical procedures then she combines this quote with kinsey s statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was involved putting two and two together kinsey s empiricism and lengthy experimentation she arrives at her hint but realizing this dog would not hunt she devoted but a single paragraph to kinsey s supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal involvement as for the alleged participation after poring over pomeroy s biography reisman found several hidden clues suggesting kinsey s likely hands on approach to kiddie sex here the chain of reasoning is more complex she points out that kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements collecting sperm and filming sex in his attic since kinsey did indeed mislead indiana university about the purpose of his cinematography he said that he was filming animal sex reisman asserts that a similar misrepresentation may yet apply to kinsey s child sex experiments catch the may reisman was also struck by kinsey s doubting thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits kinsey according to pomeroy was the type of person who needed to see things for himself pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit because he had not personally witnessed this event kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished scientist how then did kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a month old infant from the mere history of a sex offender but of course he did not he depended on their records from this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides sperm attic cumshots and climax in cottontail has reisman defamed the legendary kinsey paul gebhard succeeded kinsey as the director of the kinsey institute and now lives in retirement outside bloomington reached by telephone gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied reisman s nasty imputations i don t understand the resistance of people like reisman to studying the sexuality of children gebhard said more in exasperation than anger that is where sex begins we were happy to take data wherever we found it even though pedophiles commit criminal acts they are usually not violent folks they wouldn t be very successful if they were one of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students as for directing experiments that s absurd we never told any of our subjects what to do lt was against our principles almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective anyway nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children ourselves that would have been highly inappropriate i asked gebhard if kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual situation i think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and kinsey watched it as for kinsey s sex life it is still shrouded in confidentiality he was married to the same woman for years and fathered four children apparently there are no huge sexual revelations although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the years gebhard took his boss s history back in the s but he refuses to discuss what he knows we never divulge anything about anybody s history whether dead or alive he says reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that i had once worked for penthouse not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five years in keeping with our contentious history she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing the kinsey practice of euphemizing incest my offense was using the biblical variant lying with a near relative in a article on the subject of incest as a synonym for intercourse lying with appears eight times in genesis ed eichel is a different story though seemingly obsessed by kinsey like his coauthor he was friendly in long conversations he told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in new york university s human sexuality program in the early s it was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals he says around eichel came upon reisman s critique of kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in the sex establishment was ruled by a kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual norm no wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections eventually eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with reisman and from this union kinsey sex and fraud was born eichel s main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal uninhibited people which by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior would open the way for the second and more difficult step the ultimate goal of cross generational sex sex with children when i pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions he said weakly you don t think kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids but this is implicit in the kinsey reports meanwhile eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of kinsey and his data perfect that s just what the country needs a house un american sexual

not fit an accepted norm by that definition i would certainly be a deviant as bisexuality is not an accepted norm in american society so far this term of course really has no negative aspects inherent

disparaging you are towards political minorities sexual deviants do not comprise a political minorit y may i attempt to emulate your style of discourse with a term of abuse ahem you addle pated jellyfish the post to which i responded was a highly amusing one in which you belittled homosexuals for having no political clout i would be further amused if you would explain to me why having no political clout and constituting a political minority are different and if she had any shred of self respect she d be out the door i only associate with girls who do indeed have self respect but were and yet you call them girls the feminists would be up in arms i to find myself with the sort who would be inclined to head out the door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as homosexuality i would encourage her to indeed do so and i would further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on the way out who needs such an airhead cough cough well well you certainly are a fine upstanding fellow you are sir and like many fine upstanding fellows you have the reading comprehension of a dyslexic anteater perhaps i should have been more explicit in pointing
